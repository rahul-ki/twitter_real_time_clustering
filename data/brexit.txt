disappointed to see the conservatives with such a majority we joined the brexit party for very good reason mainly they are not tories at least brexit no deal is back on the table
labour s best bet would be starmer unlikely to win in 2024 but is well positioned to say i told you so if boris makes a mess of brexit and would be a safe option for the electorate if they tire of the tories later but that probably means he has no chance with labour members

go away the country voted brexit and the tory project the tories are going for a no deal its the tories ti blame and no one else
by complete submission anything is possible but by submitting to eu and regulatory alignment you can t then deal with us brexit is and always has been a dogs breakfast of contradictions the only constant is tories have to be in power everything else is tradeable

for the umpteenth fucking time the tories want a no deal brexit it gives them carte blanche to make us over into a shitty offshore tax haven kleptocracy and torch working people s rights
there wasn t a lot labour could really have done labour and tories were both serving labour or tory as their main course but the voters were overwhelmingly tempted by brexit pudding and couldn t be tempted by toad in the hole or beans on toast

as for the election being a second referendum on brexit anti brexit or second referendum parties won more votes than did johnson even assuming all tories were pro brexit

and yet remain parties couldn t get their shit together and win this election was won by tories because a brexit and b jeremy corbyn s support of irish nationalists in the 80s his links to hamas his inability to give a stance on brexit and the anti semitism issue
he did use his voice he fairly explicitly on more than one occasion told us we should shut up and accept brexit and arguably he also asked us to back the tories
what happened here was down to brexit corbyn won sweeping victories in 2017 when he supported brexit it was a left wing issue the tories were able to steal if you leave brexit out boris would have had nothing

we ve had a pv  as a consequence of fptp the outcome confirms the decision of euref many of us dont like it but it is a fact to suppose we can repeat the fight in 2024 is daft imho we must go forward holding tories to account as best we can within the brexit reality
it wasn t really about who people liked though it was about who had realistic policies in truth none of them did but the tories took it because everybody is sick to death of hearing about brexit and would rather get it over with than face the truth of what it will mean for us
it was made into a brexit election because the tories couldn t compete with policies add to that the toxicity of new labour leading to the trust issue and abandoning the north then there s the demonisation of jeremy corbyn propaganda is a powerful tool
the tories own brexit the fall out  consequences squarely sit at the door of this hostile austerity driven english nationalist tory government who has an on the record liar and racist leader at its helm
nothing will be done about this but call an mp a traitor and you get 28 days in prison stokies react to tel s tweet on sh tholes in north voting for tories  brexit
surely johnson will want to negotiate a close relationship with scotland it s like a comedy at this stage you can t even be sure whether tories are even being serious about brexit the ni sea border was a good joke many still think it s a real thing
don t forget in 2016 the tories connived to install a remainer leader and block boris the rise of the bxp put this right but 3 5 years were wasted the tories have copied the bxp message  policies eg opening disused branch lines boris is great but nigel is the hero of brexit
my partner and i didn t vote for the tories but i am sure my ex and my mother in law did as well as one friendly old lady in our neighbourhood d but i have nothing against this bill as i guess it sharpens the minds to get things done bbc news brexit nodeal
2 i come from a region family  work sector that i used to meet only tories but the decline in self identification as conservative in all 3 groups by the under 35s is amazing a hard brexit  a non corbynite labour leader will mean next election even fewer u35 tory votes
the tory propaganda machine has successfully fooled these people into thinking their problems are the fault of an undemocratic parliament that stopped the tories from helping them by getting brexit done the next 5 years will be a harsh lesson for them all
oh that is really sad all boris said repeatedly was get brexit dun and these guys believe it translated to tories will sort my life out all remainers and anyone left of centre has absolutely failed when we cant even reach the core who should be voting labour or libdem
we don t need you two lost elections because of self centered magic grandpa and his unelectable front bench handing the tories victory by allowing an unwinnable election and corbyn have the hard brexit they conspired to by making themselves unelectable enjoy it
we have just had a election people voted for the tories they have a big majority to get on with brexit get over it if it wasn t for remainers we would have left by now it is called democracy can t get your own way so you behave like a child
you mean 2 previous tory mp s not current quite a bit of difference after all almost all former tories are against boris over brexit and this will keep happening until the dust settles
same here legislating against his own govt doing something does seem a bit peculiar but sendss a message to both the eu  eurosceptic tories mps  voters that he is serious about getting brexit done could pass a 1 line bill amending it at a later date if he wanted to
tjere is no majority for the stupidity of brexit or the lies and greed of the tories
your own people me included made you pay for 1 corbyn 2 brexit delays and outrageous immigration policies reap what you sow although i have little faith in tories either
labour lost due to brexit yeah because it allowed ge before brexit was resolved even though it didn t want a brexit election had johnson on ropes but then passed up interim gov t on point of principle to give us this ge  five years of tories vain and incompetent
same the gloating whilst the tories continue to privatise the nhs dismantle workers rights makes plans for a no deal brexit and even threaten the bbc who were biased in their favour i cant watch any political news at the moment

superb start for the tories boris johnson s no surrender bill if there was another election next week the tories would win by even more nodeal this is parliament holding the government to account what s that not so keen when they use the law against you diddums brexit

won brexit we ll wait had see about that i ll say this though tories blaming farage for tories not getting a 100 majority is misplaced not everyone who voted bxp would have voted tory including me if i had only a tory as brexit candidate i d have spoilt my ballot paper
mine is john cruddas of labour unfortunately because the brexit party took votes from the tories the brexit party had a candidate that was a labour councillor so i suspect he fixed it because he didn t even caign in the constituency
it really surprises me that these lot want him to apologise for an election that they know was played dirty by the media the tories  a brexit stance his party pushed him in to you can t place all blame on him some yes but not all
everyone is focusing on labour and as a result they re missing the point so much of what voters are basing decisions on here and in the usa are lies brexit trump and tories will screw over the working classes in the end corbyn has fucked it but the tories will fuck us all
to any1 who voted inthe generalelection2019 on the 1simplistic soundbite issue of brexit can u please describe 2me exactly what u conceive it 2be n also what we as a nation will gain from it as both sides ofthecaign were managed by tories 4 n against just seems so odd2me
it was brexit that and the identity politics and the insufferable condescension of those like you who feel entitled to dictate how  where the little people live you folks  outlets like the guardian were and are the biggest asset the tories and brexit ever had
i see the tories are going to enshrine in law the date of the end of the transition period as the end of 2020 just like they enshrined in law the date of brexit as 29 march 2019
been awful for labour during the last two years pro brexit too just get rid of the fucking news and question time and leave the rest polly toynbee
you hope of course if the pound goes down the drain as a result of a no deal brexit whilst trump imposes the law of the jungle because he has killed off the wto certain tories are set to make a fortune selling the pound short corbyn is already a footnote
people are brainwashed and rarely able to think independently look at corbyn s position on brexit i thought it was a sensible grown up position but people were like how can we vote if we are not told what the leader thinks we deserve the tories that s the truth
i ve heard many excuses of why tories won brexit corbyn but now jonathan pie thinks it s because of labour memes and bashing tory voters i half agree that people can be too radical but everybody is responsible for their choices
he s referring to a yougov poll but a good chunk of british jews support the tories anyway so it is unlikely that alone sunk corbyn more likely his weak position on brexit that cost him there was an almost perfect correlation between leave vote and lab gt con swing in 2019
lib dems could not deliver any manifesto whatsoever if they wanted to stop brexit they should have supportedtge la our people s vote lib dem without doubt scuppered the brexit and handed the tories 56 seats

remain parties didn t get trounced brexit  ukip parties imploded while the supposedly all conquering tories increased their vote over previous worst caign in history by barely 300 000 votes story of the election was remain parties with majority of votes in a fptp system
i think it needs to go deeper for that even if people did vote for brexit the question is why what did do they want to get from it as for past governments they re always a mix of good and not so good labour dwell on past failures tories don t
is that the same archibishop who endorsed brexit tories bojo back in summer

i don t think for a moment the working class tories really thought about what we would be in for once the get brexit done bubble had popped the division in our country will only get worse
brexit the tories overwhelmingly clear election victory threatens to lead to a new kind of cockiness in case boris johnson continues to insist on not considering an extension of the transition period the pound sterling is likely to run into temporary difficulties
the tory party is so dependent on big money it now represents only a tiny elite peter geoghegan
what for having enough political nous to see through johnson s lies see the tories intention to turn the country into a low public services tax haven for the ultra rich see their gerrymandering for permanent power for seeing that and actually warning people yeah sure
seems the party is still split now rebecca v kier didn t jeremy just want to sit back and watch the tories implode over brexit that went well didn t it
more reckless game playing from the tories playing footsy with a disastrous wto brexit and not giving a damn about the impact on u k industries

to me the tories have done so much damage to our country and our people i can t forgive them for it as a disabled person i ve been treated like a 2nd class citizen for the crime of being sick brexit was never a big issue to me i despise the tories
if you don t like a religion or someone cultural garb that s your right but it is not your right to be an ass to people on the street brexit and the tories have empowered racists to believe this is ok it isn t this behaviour is disgusting
pound options are pricing 1 2815 downside risk with a 68 certainty factor this is also likely if the tories win a wafer thin majority further repricing of brexit risks would send cable back to the 1 24 1 28 range that prevailed in 2q 3q 2019
not mess up brexit obliquely pearl harbour comes to mind the japanese whacked a hammer down on the foot of an elephant and were subsequently crushed for their troubles similarly let s hope the tories don t really annoy the eu

there is that pov wanted brexit but wanted to blame the tories for delivering it it backfired on his desire to be pm is what i meant
had been having talks with the eu and they liked his brexit policy sadly that s a moot point and now we have to call the tories out when they fail which they willimo there were two types of previous labour voters who moved to the tories the self made blue collar voter increasingly elderly who disliked corbyn  his policies weren t seen as credible secondly labour leavers who thought the tories would definitely deliver brexit
finding a lot of common ground with this article tories played the system better but we must not pretend that this somehow means that they were able to solve the brexit crisis and unite the divided country nor that labour s future tasks is simply to become more centrist

just to say a big thanks to and for wasting all that extra cash paid to the eu by implementing your surrender bill you knew tories were backed by the people and brexit was inevitable but did it anyway goons
i think all of these points failed on the same issue you expected brexit to be a serious point in the election you underestimated as i did they oh i m fed already just get it over with and that labour tories and the media wanted to leave it behind
economic growth in scotland forecast to rise next year after tories election victory removed immediate threat of a no deal brexit forecast gdp growth of 1 3 for scotland in 2020 based on assumption uk govt will be able to strike a trade deal with the eu bbcgms 0710
the tories are comparatively sane compared to the brexit party think dozens of francoises and worse
defeated mp to get peerage and stay in cabinet remind us again how our democracy is so much superior to pesky foreign systems because our voters can get people out of office if they re dissatisfied with them r4today tories lbc brexit
only way to partially stop or reverse brexit is to do so in for scotland by gaining independence even propping up a labour party for an eu referendum wouldn t do it lib dems had no realistic chance of a majority and if swinson was still leader would back tories
get over yourselves you fought the general election with one policy say no to indyref  the scottish electorate resoundingly rejected the tories they voted for scotlandsrighttochoose why won t you listen they also voted again to stop brexit
i didn t call him boris i never do whilst you re correct on the urban rural split unfortunately a large part of the north has clearly turned to the tories or perhaps the shite of get brexit done undoubtedly though a large part of the north has turned away from corbyn
do you think scotland will get independence i feel brexit weirdly will ve the cause and the solution to all our problems its undeliverable remove the tories remove the problem
you let them in though why gift johnson power when you could have refused an election that you knew you couldn t win colluding with the tories to get a hard brexit when you could have taken over the agenda in parliament in coalition with the snp and libs crocodile tears
thats not a very socialist approach is it i will never understand why our party continued with an unelectable leader why at least the tories realised may had to go before they engineered a brexit election johnson was always going to win
labour should maintain a neutral stance on brexit going forward avoid being tory imitation brand avoid isolating mulitcultural fanbase for rising boris militia more importantly let the tories own their mess
labour support brexit though should but won t be saying sorry for allowing an election when the tories had nowhere to hide and were unelectable themselves
maybe but i don t think the public will be ready to hear that for a long while for now lab just need to keep their fingerprints off brexit oppose every element of johnson s deal then they can credibly blame the tories for everything when it inevitably goes to the wall
tories to appoint brexit supporting experts as peers in a bid to balance the remainiac house of lords
it s about voter perception compared to labour yes emphatically the tories are not seen as proposing major change apart from brexit labour are and are not unequivocally against brexit
shanker singham of the iea tipped to enter the house of lords as tories appoint brexit supporting experts
still the same old story from the brit left down south where snp success in beating the tories is concerned i see not the slightest bit interest in how we use civic nationalism to counter tory  brexit version of nationalism ignoring us is what they laughingly call solidarity
if you seriously believe that millions of working class people suddenly think the tories are for them you re deluded this is down to brexit nothing more nothing less under labour it would never have been delivered and we want what we voted for tory was the only option
tories to appoint brexit supporting experts as peers in a bid to balance the remainiac house of lords
yes i absolutely mean that the problem was that the conservatives would not compromise or soften anything at all to bring other parties on side brexit is so big after the ref parliament as a whole should have been involved just like the tories now want on social care
i do see your point but by the time of the next election brexit will have ostensibly happened and will be a disaster it ll also be an entirely tory mess maybe that would absolve starmer of any blame oh man i dunno i just want the fucking tories out
what s point in having equal pay act equality legislation if smoke  mirrors oh that s right we ve a regressive government that operates on 18th c conventions 99 years and tories spout about brexit being done by december 2020 farcical getusetoit
the lib dems would ve voted with labour the brexit party would ve supported the tories who knows what may have happened
we told people what he would do so i am not surprised remember people in areas where red turned blue were only concerned with brexit they believe the eu caused austerity  the tories let them 0 hours contracts will be the normal setting for employment soon
it s the corbynistas not brexit blaming brexit alone does not explain how corbyn s labour party managed to finish 6 4 percent down in areas which voted strongly for remain in 2016
it will happen because johnson got a majority mainly due to voter dislike and distrust of corbyn rather than enthusiasm for brexit but the tories own what happens next tory voters get their precious brexit and face the consequences of the damage it will do sadly we all will
general election results working class switched to tories ge2019 generalelection2019 brexit
i don t disagree but to add up the labour lib dems  assorted smaller parties share of the vote and say that they were all remainers is simplistic and incorrect the tories won a mandate for their manifesto which includes brexit anything else is irrelevant
fuck fuck fuck tories brexit nooooo fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
tories lied tory minister admits us will be able to raise prices for drugs bought by nhs after brexit
tories will lose the next election they will get brexit done and it will do for them this is 1992 and their erm is incoming
what will the tories do with this that is the big question
tories with their 80 seat majority brexit
it s an unbelievable achievement for tories to win here but shows how much people trusted them on brexit more than labour
really she and her obdurate lib dems facilitated brexit when they has a chance to stop it abstained on a vote to save the nhs and never ever forget the enabled the tories into power all the suffering is down to the lib dems and swinson voted
what it does is gives an enemy and an excuse the eu for not giving a good deal and treating us so badly that that they have left us with no choice but to no deal brexit do not for one moment think any tories will put what is best for the country over party ideology
uk made pledge to take 2000 migrant children 7 ral yrs ago that promise like many others broken  not likely to happen with post brexit xenophobic government about to instal fortress iron girder immigration barriers broken promises tories get use to it
i have no idea why we are using leave remain to endorse a new labour leader brexit shouldn t be an issue in the next ge if it is the tories wont have any credibility anyway pick the best candidate that can bring back traditional voters some named wont do that
i ve made the point elsewhere that the tories targeted these areas because they considered the vote soft malleable  susceptible to simplistic slogans such as get brexit done labour ignored the polls  failed to prioritise  provide a counter narrative in many of these areas
what brexit tories first priority is to ban anti semitic boycotts envoy says
the manifesto big document contained indyref2 and opposition to brexit i know tories didn t do one so you might not know what it is bellend
the british nationalists are frothing at the mouth election result in scotland must still be raw 4th mandate for indyref2 so far how many times will we have to vote for indyref2 and against brexit to get listened to everytime tories say no more people in scotland say yes
the house of lords needs being made much smaller or abolishing altogether tony blair appointed so many labour peers it s now dis functional
more voted against the tories than for them if boris has a renewed and powerful mandate for brexit then nicola has a mandate for indyref2 justsayin
why don t you eff off you irrelevant nobody you keep bleating on about brino  the brexit party you might not have realised but we had this thing called an election last week where the country put its trust in boris tories  roundly rejected the irrelevancy of farage s bxp
ii think calling someone scum is insulting them we ll have years of tories but that s cos people fell for the narrative incl get brexit done  failed to read their manifesto a normal ge wud have seen a very different result power grab on the way autocratic govt will follow
first out the blocks tories won t be honouring pledge to protect workers rights it was only a pledge they ll blame everything on eu intransigence and go for excuse of no deal no money

i am sorry but i profoundly disagree the real poison is not social media but a project called brexit designed by right wing populists  tories for people in general of an older generation lies lies and liars caused the poison not social media
brexit is tory not labour it is easy to misunderstand a political system far away tories did this right wing media obfuscates details tories pushed brexit on racism then falsely called corbyn an anti semite to blur story
absolutely correct i told the fbpe cult the damage they were ding and we would get another tory gvt but oh no they fell for tory infiltrators into their cult and completely ignored the tories who 100 own brexit and attacked jeremy corbyn 24 7 relentlessly fecking idiots

tories call for urgent investigation into 3million that george soros funnelled into anti brexit caign aimed at bringing down boris johnson it s time that the world lock up george soros and his crimes against humanity
if corbyn s so shite why did 10 2 million vote labour it just doesn t stack up without brexit the tories would have been screwed
there is not a crossover between voting snp or say libdems znd supporting indy or brexit tories clearly supported against snp mp gethins in fife for exle it gives an idea but different question and very different franchise
no tories in scotland when is scotexit from uk and will parliament blick it as they blocked brexit
i hope brexit destroys their communities especially in ex industrial towns i hope job losses soar lets face it tories will give them same response they gave jarrow marchers
i mean you had it earlier when you said they had wishy washy policies on brexit the eu policing tax trade deals the antisemitism is the same as the endless racism coming from the tories even with the endless bbc drumbeating no one really gave a shit
and if a large number of people as you claim accept as truth anything the media says then labour would ve fared much better even w uk media s fairness doctrine they are still heavily biased towards labour  anti brexit constantly implying tories are racist islamophobic etc
that is unfair i have stressed and worried about no deal brexit and the tories winning this ge even though i will pay less tax under a tory gov i voted labour but will not donate money to a gov who will pass it to the richest in our society whilst we have children going hungry

the electorate radicalised into 30 no deal  15 revoke compared to the electorate being less certain on the brexit outcome in 2017 that inevitably impacted on how the parties reacted to it depending on their remain leave composition the tories in the end had a simpler message
this will be an unpopular take with the folks who follow me really on a roll lately huh but all things considered given the circumstances this is good can t change what s happened maybe it s best we just let the tories get brexit done and fast so the country can move on
they blamed jeremy for things the tories had done because they were too unintelligent to find out the truth no i m sorry but i say let them have the suffering they voted in they thought it was just about brexit they did not think about the rest of it
george is 100 correct labour betrayed the british people by ignoring their wishes and becoming the anti brexit party they handed the tories a victory labour  working class people will pay for this for a long time
when the reality of brexit hits magic grandpa is just as if not more culpable than the conservatives he knew the damage it will unleash and he allowed it to happen the tories are bastards we know that we expected better of labour 3
you have literally a single piece of actual evidence that corbyn is an anti semite you hit me up with that shit also i supported labour in that election because the alternative a rushed tory brexit was literal economic suicide for the uk that s it not the tories
the year is 2084 the brexit referendum is coming up again you a non binary latinx double 0 agent have been tasked with finding a spoon that once belonged to golda meir said to be the only thing that could possibly give the tories a chance time is running out
dear tories and borisjohnson supporters brexit tory torys
labour has nothing to lose now by opposing a tory brexit all the way on practical grounds no need to be remain forget the ideological stance go for the nitty gritty let the tories own this mess and build a proper opposition to the harm they will unleash on the country
that s what they get for electing tories still they overwhelmingly want 2 make nhs stronger not dismantle it even tories make promises in that regard brexit caign slogan was literally for the nhs any1 who lives under single payer hc won t trade it for anything
also notice brexit party caused labour seat losses and in in terms of total voters tories didn t even really go up as a overall
i agree hard lesson to learn but there are tens of thousands that will go through process over coming years tories will not change they will not become socially caring it was photo opportunity nothing more in meantime tories are already at the trough  it s feeding time
i think we can assume that most everyone who voted tory knew they were voting for brexit had the tories not won a majority i m willing to bet your position would be that brits voted against brexit
no one trusts the liberal undemocrats i heard they have set up special shops where you can sell you grandma and principles for some power colluded with tories on everything they say against insisted on fixed term elections student loan pledges overturn brexit no say
hoorah nobody cares we re not a nation of woke liberals and the sooner the tories wake up to this deep swell of anger amongst the populous the sooner they ll realise why they won so well it presents as brexit but it goes much deeper
no she doesn t it was the tories who won the election for the snp independence was always plan b in this election it is only now that they have been defeated on brexit that we are hearing about independence
i would have said yes before the 2019 ge if he had stood down tories who are for brexit would have got over 100 seats one of those saved for the labour part by brexit votes was yvette cooper

worked even better for the tories defunded everything put people on austerity blamed the closures  breakdowns on labour slowing brexit down large percentages of voters believe them landslide to tories pity the media weren t doing their job as the 4th estate
tories have majority now but it will need a high level of competence in the government to get the best for britain brexit always needed it majority government it also needs a strong competent one or risk getting a bit manipulated agreeing to some less attractive deals
but it was not the collective will in that sense brexit distorted the election in england because a lot of working class voters were leavers and lent their votes to the tories to get brexit done plus the labour party went too far left for them but they will not support more
that argument is over i m sorry it is good that it s the tories that will have to deliver on the easiest trade deal in history it will be shit show like every other step in brexit but it has to happen i d be in favour of not accepting a rejoin application from england
tories boris labour conservatives brexit the thread is well worth the read
so much for getting brexit done to stop us being ruled by unelected officials
voters opted for the tories instead of the brexit party let s hope they re not disappointed in the months to come boris should tear up the enforced surrender treaty keep the 39bn and just leave on jan 31st
everyone complains when we say we call people who voted tories unintelligent however it was labour who wanted to end zero hour contracts tories introduced it tories won on getting out of the eu these blokes are more likely to end up on the streets than to be helped
shock horror tories not keeping to their promises never after all those people who just didn t like corbyn because everyone else had some shit excuse or none or some face they pulled when asked if they were voting labour hope he fucks it right up
the tories vote went up less than 2 overall with the brexit party they picked up just 335 000 votes labour lost 2 5 million votes nearly twice as many of these votes went to pro remain parties than to the parties supporting leave pissupinabrewery
the media is deliberately and studiously ignoring the fact that the tories only won because farage s plan worked but farage hates johnson s deal and so does most of the brexit coalition ge2019 was not some victory for tory ideology it was the leave vote reasserting itself
it s great but his numeric comparison of remain parties to tories is disingenuous what about brexit party false premise

why would the lib dems pass over or bring down a corbyn led minority govt in favour of a second election if a pv was on offer the tories were never an option given their brexit stance and the coalition experience ergo in many a eyes a vote for lib dems was a vote for corbyn 9
they clearly haven t realised that labour introduced workers rights in respect of zhc s due to huge companies taking advantage of their lack of rights the tories are now looking to scrap these rights and have more power to do so with brexit and no eu laws to adhere to plonkers

i actually think starmer would absolutely destroy johnson but is he just going to let the blairites back in people say he s a remainer and responsible for our brexit policy but brexit is now fully owned by johnson  the tories we ve gone through the brexit door now
no sarah murphy the tories won because they promised brexit
it s good but he compares remain vs tories in leave seats the real issue was votes to brexit party allowing tories through so false premise rest is great though i think either fully remain or fully leave were ble d last of a wider strategy no political craft though
when you find out your sister who s on esa voted for the tories because of brexit
well i have woken up to a labour government in my lifetime and it felt bloody brilliant i want everyone i know to experience that i think brexit may be the downfall of the tories forever
more votes went to remain people s vote parties than to the tories and brexit party
no they weren t they were definitely going to put a soft brexit against remain in another referendum that s nothing like the brexit tories it bp were offering
i mean the tories used brexit as a smokescreen to cover up their frankly pathetic domestic record
critically as brexit effects start to bite how will there be the money for labour heartlands reinvestment northern transport promises and of course nhs investment it won t be plain sailing for the tories
erm brexit yes it is crazed experiment boosting 92 then in the sense of freeing of fiscal shackles but we still had a kicking from a recession for 18 months my point was erm was death of perceived economic competence in the tories publicly brexit bets uk on a horse at kempton
no doubting corbyn unpopular smears worked but that s not the whole story in lots of places tory vote barely changed but lots of lab leavers voted brexit so tories slipped through middle don t get me wrong brexit will fuck uk but lab couldn t have won on remain ticket

not everybody that voted tories is a racist but many racists voted tory and racists feel emboldened by the massive win like after the brexit referendum i am a foreigner and i felt the nastiness and it s the same for british ethnic minorities they get it and we foreigners 2
neither does boris boris like trump is a fake patriot clive is ex military  a decent man which may cut thru against such a phoney opponent doesn t need 2 apologise 2 win against boris he needs 2 stand his ground doesn t matter what anyone voted on brexit now tories own it
sounds like people who voted tories will enjoy a no deal brexit a dream come true
i m afraid mate you are so wrong don t blame brexit the media stupid voters or even the tories take a long hard look in the mirror antisemitism terrorist supporting bullying and treating the electorate like fools
he needs to fill the house of lords with his tories to ram brexit through by 1st feb
how how have they convinced these people that they are the party of the working class when the tories have never given a shit about the working class before the party has been screwing you over for the last 10 years and you think they are a good choice to vote for
agreed but the tories were very clear once voted in brexit would be done ticktock
a vote for the lib dems was just a way for remainers to get the tories back into power without taking the blame personally for brexit
brexit had nothing to do with europe at all then i hope the tories have a terrible time because they caused this
well said richard it was brexit  the right wing billionaire owned media shielding the tories from public scrutiny not holding them to account  spreading fake news against labour that is the cause the current labour policies are exactly what our country needs solidarity
are you including the 600 k of people that voted brexit party or the thousands that voted for pro brexit independent candidates i think you ll find it s still more tories and a tory gov even under a pr system albeit technically a hung parliament
and yet they ll keep voting for him because as long as they have a brown mexican neighbour then they must be getting poorer same story in the uk the midlands voted for tories and yet they will be hit the hardest with brexit lunatics
no comments on brexit you don t say much for a speaker are you happy that the tories won
look brexit is done now we have to concentrate on our home we have to attack the tories at every level and hold them to account we need to have a strong cohesive message learn from cummings do a job back on them
reeeeeaaaaally i think you ll find you are incorrect even if we had a directly proportional representation system we would have a hung parliament with the tories still the largest party and the brexit party would have had 10 seats too
britain did not elect a bj government tories would be 40 seats short of a majority without the 81 seats the electoral system gave them but those so keen on democracy wrt brexit aren t bothered by this it seems
to get back into government we need to expand beyond labour voters we need former tories liberals and non voters a confusing brexit position does not do this and many remainers now support getting brexit done as they want it out of their lives this is reality
no but i think there were bigger issues affecting the whole party e g brexit position media covering up for tories so voters didn t believe labour anti corbyn media caigns  bias
blaming the lib dems for tory victory is like blaming democracy for labour s downfall if the system fptp cannot allow for plurality of views the system should be blamed and changed lib dems were the only sane option for anti brexit voters stopfirst
easy all tories were unified behind brexit and that was what the election was about they won because labour brexiters and it didn t require many in each electorate voted tory swinging the balance in bojo s favour there was no unity of labour and remain easy
nigel gave us brexit nigel gave us boris nigel gave boris a majority nigel won the election for the tories very different result without the brexit party standing and standing down where it did handed it to boris on a silver platter indeed where is the thanks
so voting lib dem s has enabled a tory brexit and robbed labour of seats it could have won increasingly the tory majority there is no point in the lib dem s existing unless you are the tories that is we don t need them in the labour party
the crushing defeat of the left was also caused by the lib dems splitting the vote as for the election being a second referendum on brexit anti brexit or 2nd referendum parties won more votes than did johnson even assuming all tories were pro brexit
this disparity is because five parties supported remain while 2 1 2 parties because the brexit party stood in just half the seats supported leave this is unfair because tories were certainly going to win with many seats there were only two leave parties
next ge wont be for at least 5 years in that time with such a strong majority tories will truly own brexit we need someone really forensic sensible and slick to fully hold them to account throughout for the inevitable cluster fuck and provide zero distraction for the media

tories to appoint brexit supporting experts as peers in a bid to balance the remainiac house of lords 
my opinion on the performance of the labour  labourleadership jeremycorbyn  the bunch of his feminist fans is that in fact labour are useful idiots for tories  borisjohnson  brexit voters conservatives will support labour now as decoration of democracy bbcpapers
you lost 2 ge  cannot bring yourselves to say sorry to everyone that voted  trusted labour winning this argument now will not put food on tables of people labour party was founded to protect from tories your failure is profound  negligence by brexit default is disgusting
aside from corbyn s image reputation the most common explanation given to me is about honouring the decision of the euref its democracy 3yrs of talking etc etc so support for tories other than brexit is weak might not be by 2024 tho
hard to believe she was siding with smug tories and voting with them on brexit
well plebs you voted for him you reap what you sow no complaining now turkeys conservatives tories ge2019
the tories can now move slightly to the left investing in northern and midlands towns reversing austerity etc but also do what we as a party will not get brexit done control immigration and oppose identity politics that combination could keep labour out for a generation
the problem is that the tories are unlikely to give security to the poorest in society the ones who most need it it is all about empathy and resources and the right often seem to lack both in this light brexit will one day be seen as a national tragedy
i got sooooooo tired of telling you brexit party guys he would over and over was all don t trust tories don t trust tories he s not a real leaver well he is i told you so
st j couldn t have handed this win to the tories any better if he d tried actually had he tried to lose he might ve done better he s that bad at everything refusing to work with ld pissing everyone off on brexit making giveaways that scared anyone with money
labour then put themselves in the stupid position of having an unelectable leader in corbyn brexit defunded labour local authorities a shit labour leader votes to tories you can scream until you re blue in the face on social media about austerity but locally
has neil not hear how few seats labour would have won if 10 remainers hadn t swung back to labour also the idea that labour could ever out tory the tories on brexit an issue of patriotism and natiolism is just ridiculous
snp all the way they are standing up for scotland and against brexit and the tories never changed their politics dramatically never climbed into bed with tories but stuck with scottish independence that s why
contains a load of utter garbage wait till the reality of brexit and the tories hits home there will be an awful lot of disappointed people tough
i e the tories having already told people brexit is the answer to all their problems the tories have also defunded labour councils so much people are sick and see them as the answer it s deception it s clever it s called playing the long game
the brexit nationalists now in power will escalate blame gaming the eu for everything including bananas possibly to crisis this is what they have done for years sadly it seems to work but long term austerity pain for millions cutting the nhs that was the tories not the eu

labour loses eleven remain seats lds hold the cards more of a cliffhanger of a parliament than a hung one because the stop brexit lds ruled out working with corbyn which leaves them stuck with the getbrexitdone tories we can only imagine how that would pan out sarc
dominant issue was brexit and you hid from it you didn t tackle the tories on it because your position was ridiculous a centrist hamster would have done better
the diehard unionists in uklabour scotland have come up with a splendid way of nullifying the ge result 43 for the tories is not a mandate for brexit if 45 is not a mandate for indyref2 but refreshing to see other labour figures accepting the democratic mandate for indyref2
and i also see the racism coming from the working class people who rant about brexit sovereignty and traitors love farage call labour hard left and marxist and think the tories will save them from the horrendous conditions caused by um the tories
brexit might blow over but my and many other people s feelings for the politicians who dismissed labour leavers will never blow over these two were at the forefront of leaving many politically homeless and ultimately going to the tories bxp
tories to appoint brexit supporting experts as peers in a bid to balance the remainiac house of lords 
you re completely disregarding the malicious lies spread by the murdoch press the tories lying voter apathy due to brexit and mountains of other issues tories lie better than labour can tel the truth
also corbyn and co could have been voted out but brexit is irrevesible not to mention other damage tories will do dismantling welfare state and selling off nhs
ahhhh the sunlituplands hope all those plucky northern tories will be basking in the infinite tangible everyday benefits of a hard brexit

brexit might blow over but my and many other people s feelings for the politicians who dismissed labour leavers will never blow over these two were at the forefront of leaving many politically homeless and ultimately going to the tories bxp
let s face it tories won as soon as boris was able to marry the party to brexit
so people who voted for brexit are bad and you wonder why tories won the election
the tories are totally bigoted and have been found guilty but not reported across the board they wanted brexit so did those papers and media mentioned above labour are racist how some in the party are anti semitic yes but than people are in all parties
if brexit was about democracy why aren t people up in arms about the tories apparent landslide due not to voters but to an electoral system that took 81 seats off other parties for them
in 5 years time it ll be the people who held the tories to account on brexit who we ll be using to win it s not like brexit will be sunlit uplands in 5 years labour are an opposition party they re not the cheerleading squad
there are some people that can t join the dots between the erg brexit johnson and the tory vote they gave on friday hearing some bleat on that they re not happy with tories but love brexit brexit is tory you ve been played and goodbye to tory election promises
there s an eejit on saying the tories manipulated there to be a brexit seriously he really believes it
then the tories have less of a mandate for brexit
still waiting for the blairites red tories and the zionists to apologise brexit election end of
the lack of answers they seemed happy with indicates otherwise not knowing what brexit entailed for them under the tories wilful ignorance out at any cost is what they asked for funny they value democracy despite reading p48 and elected a racist classist sexists liar
they were at 26k this time slightly down but turn out was higher maybe due to leavers who don t usually vote coming out for tories rare to get labour labour switchers but have met a couple soft labour brexit not perceived as real brexit by some
i think that if going into the election both labour and the tories had the others policy on brexit instead of the ones they did have it would be corbyn as pm now and not boris the last ge was really the second brexit referendum
already broken promises are so worth it just to get brexit done init even though brexit ain t getting done for a long while and he s gunna make sure we have a shit deal coz these selfish pigs don t give af about us yet people chose the conservatives the dirty tories
shame they were so hateful for so many centuries then forever changing the course of nations and races of people now you have brexit and the tories giving racism and hate a voice they deem legitimate hating on anyone and everyone not english worse for those that aren t so
in remember the same being said about the tory party after new labour s landslide win labour or some version of it will bounce back the pessimism is that folk who will be hardest hit by brexit  cared least for by the tories voted for them but they ll never admit their errors
dear this is on you instead of going for an option of settling brexit one way or another you facilitated the tories once again please do enjoy the next elections this is to make no deal the default removing all blame from himself
theres people at the end of their tether because of nine yrs of tories real suffering for the tories to fool these ppl into voting for them telling them they will get brexit done as if that caused their hardship is contemptible and dangerous for democracy
some people just can t swallow the disaster that is brexit like suicidal lemmings charging over the cliff those that see the cliff coming are staring in disbelief they re about to be pushed over the edge it s going to run it s course now the tories have won
labour is finished also didn t you vote brexit the tories have been in charge for over 10 years nothing has ever been privatised or sold off we still get free healthcare
does brexit even exist or did the tories just make it up to get votes
starmer with thornberry as for tories to deliver brexit they only care about no deal as brexit is an oxymoron hence why labour offered a ref labour always had the solutions but tories had bought  paid for media russian interference trump et al
thought they wanted or would be maybe the lds might be in a stronger position if brexit damages the tories but labour would also adapt it s position and policies i know there is alot of hope for a female leader but i think starmer is the most uniting
you know what those of us feeling like crap about brexit and these racists here we really don t have it worse than so many people around the world and we definitely don t have it as bad as many periods of time in history so 5 10 more years of tories whilst bad isn t as bad
this helps it stops the brexit question disrupting our country again we have to move on now it comes back to the delivery capability of the tories looking at what they have already done the electorate might wake up again sooner rather than later lets ensure he gets it done
well there s nothing the tories do better than to get in formation i guess but i m still amazed the rhetoric of get brexit done didn t put more tory remainers off but then i was pretty gobsmacked by some of the reasons given for not voting labour so maybe i know nothing
that is the factor that will stop a recovery the wrong leader and a failure to address the lack of appeal to those in the north and midlands that felt the need to switch to push brexit through however don t discount the difficulties the tories have ahead
deluded and a loser ran an us v them caign driven by fear eg nhs not safe in tories hands etc total nonsense ran a fear caign whereas boris caign was very positive get brexit done
people actually think the tories are keeping the north after brexit lmao
nonsense john curtice said the brexit party took more votes from tories you did great work up to the calling of the election and then lost the plot egos remember tories can t take seats held by labour for 50 years well they could and they did here is tbp legacy
and boris  the tories only got 43 does that mean they don t have a mandate for brexit
2 the caa claims to be non party political its website review of the main political parties excluding the brexit party gives labour a higher antisemitism score than either the tories or ukip the caa s website discloses the full flavour of this organisation
fell by the wayside unfortunately when you give people a choice and then try to deny them that choice they are going to flick v signs we say the tories were pulled apart by brexit sadly it was our undoing on that issue alone we gave the tories the win perhaps it doesn t
irrelevant to five years time a decent proportion of labour leaders switched either because of get brexit done or corbyn neither will hopefully be a factor in five years and the tories will have hit a few bumps in the road with johnson and his useless cronies at the helm
i doubt labour lost many remain voters where d they go lib dems they barely kept a few of lib demmers tories maybe a few staunch defenders of democracy went that way abstained voting labour pretty much was abstaining re brexit so why desert them they lost 2mill leavers
good luck to you and them for voting the vile tories i ll ask you again when you re on universal credits when the economy tanks because of brexit
i mean obviously this guy should be in ukip or the brexit party and nowhere near the governing party of this country it also tells us a lot and not good things about the vetting process of the tories
jeanette you so get it british tories brexit considered the conservative players in parliament do not involve the onus of our social conservative platform making for a much easier win the dimms are corbynites but the gop platform is the sticking point
well the tories own brexit now for good or ill it s theirs
but it s tories brexit not convinced that translates to better off
and it s bit contempt that i feel it s more a sense of being disheartened that people knowingly fell for the lies the tories put out and that they placed a tory brexit above the damage caused by the last 9 years of tory austerity and they voted for a party that shafted them
the working class are thick is not a great sentiment it brought about brexit destroyed the labour party  handed the tories a majority on a silver platter
aaaaaand the tories are slowly beginning to complain about what they voted for one by one aight son you still voted for this at the end of the day despite the warnings and the proven and obvious facts so shush i swear you all only voted for brexit
the plan was to sort brexit out the tories were not capable corbyn doesn t just give it to you straight he doesn t lie he s honest wouldn t you rather that quality in a truly democratic leader
at 2 it s pretty fair to say that brexit party have little to no statistical analysis but whatever buy into this false narrative put rlb in charge and watch the tories walk it in 2024 too if the british left wants to set itself on fire then it can
it s what they have always wanted a no deal brexit disgusting tories liars and cheats
not after they suffer tories for the next 5 years public liked the socialist policies brexit was the sticking point and although they didn t know why to a man they didn t like media demonised corbyn 18 24 group majority voted labour they don t watch tv or read msm
couldn t disagree more keir is the ultimate architect of brexit position  is seen by all those folk the party need to attract back from the tories as is emily thornberry as a major part of the problem not the solution besides he s nowhere near capable enough
these times are toxic largely because has been outrageously pro remain and pro tory for 3 5yrs which is odd because you d think the two positions are incompatible until you remember the tories are led by honest boris portillo brexit in name only under boris
corbyn said something like he wants there to be a great deal of movement after brexit with no cap on numbers  migrants able to bring their whole family the tories promised to cut numbers look at public opinion  consider the better strategy
up till 2017 the issue of brexit was more problematic for the tories by 2019 brexit had become toxic
according to labour the bbc was biased against them and that s one of the reasons why they lost the election they re a bunch of deluded dingbats i can t remember a single time when the bbc supported brexit or the tories
not as confusing as your logic old sport 52 voted for brexit in 2016 the brexit party won the european elections and the tories won the 2019 general election but keep massaging the stats if you like it might be better if you acknowledge defeat and move on with your life
we all become brexiteers next year the tories lose their only way of identifying with its 2019 voters labour needs to elect a leader who can tackle the government s post brexit domestic policies with authority but more importantly communicate sound and credible alternatives
a second risk for it joins the brexit converts just as toryhardbrexit runs into problems far from the tories owning brexit shares the blame but not the power learn from milliband ans austerity

tories rejected by 57 of the population no mandate for brexit
my favorite thing happening in brexit now would be the members of the growing some balls  voting down the eu boris agreement as the hoc voted down may s one 2 times  see what tories do january31
not terrible advice to be honest the tories have been pathetic the last 9 yrs blown out debt cuts to public services but still manage to over spend and then they completely cock up brexit should have had it done by now this election only gave them 30 more seats than ge15
she said she would never serve under bojo and she s not even a fucking mp oh yeah tories brexit so much democracy
agreed a lot of mistakes made along the way but wondering if history will show this was not a bad election to lose can feasibly see tories imploding over the next 5 years under the weight of get brexit done
the tories will pull every dirty trick i think 5 years facing johnson down across the dispatch box will be proof enough starmer was hands down the best thing on labour s front bench in the brexit and prorogation debates it would be negligent not to appoint him

great point we re all acting like the election was the end of something but the opposite is true this is just the beginning and the tories now have to deliver and outperform any uk government ever just to keep things as good as they are now brace for brexit

it s just another way the tories are saying fuck the people anyone who voted for them is insane
the tories caigned relentlessly on getting brexit done now tories and centrists pretend brexit didn t matter that much considering both labour libdems results there simply wasn t a big enough constituency for delaying or revoking brexit

even with the tories and brexit i still think the worst british things are magnolia walls and feature walls
im so glad that when we were asked to choose between chaos with ed milliband or stability under the tories we chose the definitely stable definitely not chaotic option with an attached brexit referendum

why would it everyone knows what snp stands for just like scottish tories never had brexit on their leaflets anyway tories labour and lib dem s all had it on their leaflets so i m sure the message got through loud and clear
no caroline flint was the author of her own demise she voted with the tories this is what happens when you pretend to be a socialist and prove you are a tory all along what is brexit going to do for her cosntituents nobody has ever answered that she look at herself
no party is in touch with all of their voters my understanding is that brexit was the driving force on this election that being said if the tories try to tear up the nhs you will see a flip of support it is just the nature of politics
right and they are separate things more people voted for brexit than the snp but more people voted to remain in eu than people voted to leave in scotland so scotland voted to remain snp same argument majority of vote share in comparison with tories uk wide so
conservative u k prime minster johnson backs brexit 100 yet looking at the total vote share for pro brexit parties vs parties who favour a second eu referendum tells a different story the vote share comes to 52 per cent
the manifesto was not radical at all and in 2017 labour performed better this was a brexit election and the brexiters won if labour also gives up on its values then the tories will have won more than one election but the next decade or two
no one working class voted for the tories they voted for the brexit party which allowed the tories to sweep the north
the 2017 ge the tories lost because there was hope labour might back a 2nd ref and people realised they were unsure about brexit so they didn t give full powers in 2019 they were just tired of brexit and bj gave the mantra get it done
interesting what tories really think about their new voters nigel evans tory mp and hard brexiter said on about brexit there ve been more extensions than a housing estate in essex not only did kay burley not pick this up but the comment was shown many times
brexit is just an excuse if it hadnt been brexit it would have been we want a rerun scotland voted against the tories or we want a rerun theres an r in the month or we want a rerun theres a haggis shortage brexit is an excuse simples fortunately boris has said no
how the hell can actually be a union when their members are majority pro remain their official policy is remain yet len mccluskey is using their platform to say labour has collapsed into 2nd ref and needs to match tories on brexit rhetoric clear abuse of trust
that s because these people think the cause of poverty homelessness nhs waits food banks is because of too many foreigners they voted tory because they believe tories and brexit are going to sort that out
funded by god knows who spent time in russia tried to get a labour brexit deal with the tories earlier this year and lying about his party policy as they offered a second ref with their own deal on the table certainly didn t back remain which was a major problem dodgy dodgy
you ve got to feel for the corbyn cult not appreciating the ge might be about brexit if only the tories had come up with a snappy 3 word caign slogan to give them a clue
this is shocking yet they are voted back in again like turkeys voting for christmas brexit tories lies
stupid decision to call a ge lack of unambiguous brexit policy failure to realise most labour supports are remain chasing the same demographic as the tories and farage failure to work with other parties and no focus pretty much all corbyn s fault
you know who said ignore the prophets of doom brexit will be good for britain now he advises lib dems to disband after they helped the tories to victory yeah right corbyn whipped to trigger a50 refused a ref what a sick country
yes it seems brexit will happen but that doesn t alter the fact that remain and 2nd referendum supporting parties polled more than half the votes and the tories themselves only achieved 46 yes it s the largest share but hardly an ovewhelming majority
i agree here in hull we ended up with all 3 labour remain mps getting in only just but they still got in more people didn t vote for them split between brexit tories very disappointing
scots nats want independence at any cost scottish people want independence because if the tories and because of the tories brexit like me
they did help the tories in quite a lot of seats in the south and in particular helped ian duncan smith and rees mogg hold on but labour would have still lost by about 60 70 seats so not devastating it was brexit in the north and midlands that got johnson his majority
just like the tories with their brexit then
there is an unseemly rush to lay blame for labour s electoral defeat some say corbynism others say brexit jc must resist the pressure to go until efforts are made to find out through focus groups what led so many voters to switch to the tories  there must be no civil war
ok twitter my ten pence during the days of speeches on brexit jess phillips was the one that stood out calling all the tories gutless saying that she called corbyn out to his face but you lot whinge about your mates being expelled and you sit there gutless cowards you are
interesting you say that so you think the tories have a mandate for brexit on 43 6 of the share vote and 53 of seats so you will agree the snp have a mandate on 45 of the share vote and 81 of scottish seats or you going to twist democracy for your agenda
the votes went from labour to the tories not to the lib dems maybe if lab and the lds had actually formed a pact like the brexit party spit and the tories did we wouldn t be here the point was to curb the tories that failed
one reason labor lost last week was because the tories had a clear concise message and labor released their brexit plan as a novella where in the end nobody knew where they stood if you want to be understood and supported by voters brevity is key
former labour council leader colin lambert s decision to run for the brexit party did his former party few favours seemingly squeezing their vote in the end that may have been decisive with the tories edging ahead by just 663 votes
the tories have nothing to say apart from cuts and privatisation once brexit is out of the way i really think they re in trouble 15 years in power means they ll be super unpopular public will crying out for change whoever lab leader is
we must keep working with the youth as a longer term strategy but the threat is immediate we need a brave wise individual that both sides will respect who is smart enough to out fox the tories from a position of weakness got any ideas brexit might be our saviour yet
like it was always going to because people always start moving back to the big parties in an election an even then a large chunk did not come back in leave voting areas that had gone from labour to the brexit party in eu elections then tories in general election
they think brexit means the tories will make this happen i doubt they re alone

i ve heard that the tories version is brexit is brino so huge irony
anti democratic tories have no mandate in scotland for brexit stick your tory dictatorship in the sea dissolvetheuk
i ve checked a few more of these and you seem to be ignoring the extra votes picked up by the brexit party and the tories themselves in most of the seats i checked those votes were far greater than those lost to lib dem  green
i think that was a reflection on how badly tories were doing at the time with the disaster they were making of brexit infighting all over the place  tm doing badly no charisma a strong lab leader should have had a majority win at that point  have won decisively
brown miliband and corbyn failed labour needs a leader who is electable and can hold the tories to account brexit will be disaster for many and labour must be ready
a line up to scare the tories would be leader cooper deputy gardiner shad chan long bailey s home starmer s foreign benn s ed rayner s health nandy s brexit miliband s leader of house butler s justice thornberry s housing comms philips tea boy burgon no chance
another leave seat same pattern all i m saying is labour is losing votes everywhere to the lds to the greens to the tories to staying at home it s a party which people no longer believe in at present that s the key factor above brexit
stephen kinnock s pro brexit stance caused a cabal of rebel labour mp s to abandon the whip  vote with the tories for boris johnson s appalling deal it was fear the labour whip would collapse entirely that led to the general election corbyn being unelectable led to the result
pressure from without worked before  there s more reason to suggest that it will again given labour s state in scotland the tories have painted themselves into a brexit corner  they ll be punished for it in due course we just have to be ready for when that time comes
preferably without everything in the wa and pd don t sacrifice our fishing water money laws defence and true independence the brexiteers have voted for brexit 3 times now and saved the skin of the tories don t sell them out by pandering to those who didn t vote for you
they ve just identified an issue that unbelievably really provides a connection between someone like jacob rees mogg and and someone on a zero hours contract in grimsby brexit has been the best thing to have happened to the tories really
unfortunately there were lies and a smear caign to influence the way the people in the steet voted problem is a lot of people took it as gospel run with it and dont check things out tories got in because of their dishonesty and brexit
i don t necessarily agree that the tories are in touch with the north they ve won old labour strongholds i understand that but i think that would have a lot to do with brexit and also mistrust in labour leadership and the party itself less about tory s speaking to the north
you re correct it was not all about brexit it was all about the privileged corporate tories being kept in place by the ruling establishment and all those who support them are complicit in the deaths already caused and the deaths that are to follow
lol brexit is going to break england and we are not going to be able to assist you had a horrible choice on anti semitic labor and tories but you screwed the pooch hope you enjoy the rich getting richer and healthcare going private
it has nothing to do with my opinion on the tories which you do not know it has nothing to do with brexit i answered lbc s question which is about marketing  branding if labour had been elected and called themselves the people s government i would disagree with that too
wow labour member from the south on lbc the north have only lent their votes to the tories when we re proved right  they re devastated by brexit they ll flock back to us finishes by saying labour need keir starmer that attitude caused this mess ffs
it s just a damn shame that labour kept 33 43 leave seats because the brexit party and tories split the vote if boris had been brave enough to caign on no deal he would have 400 mps now
eu nationals 16 17 year olds labour for indy tories for indy greens rise a proportion would vote indy your screen shot is a pathetic attempt show the same for remain and leave for ruk tories lost as well on their get brexit done manifesto
i agree i think we are into the fire now the racist have been given credence anyone who thinks brexit tories weren t going to use racism as fuel to ignite their far right agenda were not paying attention let s face it they frigging well hate us
if you aren t a millionaire and voted for the tories you re an idiot i don t know how that could be made any plainer
had the tories stood down in her seat yvette cooper would have lost easily a good number of seats were like that boris  tories clearly preferred having labour mps elected than a single brexit party mp
don t forget matt hancock and plans for martial law in britain tories brexit

this tory government s reckless approach to brexit will send the country straight off the nodeal cliff threatening jobs the environment and the nhs liberal democrats will continue to stand up for remainers up and down the uk
all those huge international companies that relocated here as a result of brexit will now recruit every single one of us as a result we will all drive to our new highly paid jobs in gold cars and we will all holiday in the sunlit uplands
what currency will you use cadbury buttons would be worth more than the in a few years time
bullshit where was he on the marches why was he on holiday during the referendum why did he whip to trigger art 50 why was he so late and reluctant to offer a second ref that he d be neutral over why was he spinning jobs first brexit he s a leaver and we all suffer
it s just as well there s no way that any of boris johnson s hedge fund donors could possibly have known about this announcement before he made it
you mean will ditch promise to guarantee workers rights and environmental protections after brexit don t you northerners have no jobs  no money you think they get any of this they voted them in
watch the exodus and demise of businesses watch whole towns disintegrate watch brexit and tory voters rejoice at the disappearance of their jobs their homes their lives
13 open free ports 14 encourage investment to create jobs in areas decimated by de industrialisation 15 make brexit day a bank holiday in perpetuity call it independence day 16 remove eu flags from all public buildings replace with union flags
i understand what you mean yet asking him to explain to party members his stance on brexit didn t help some local mps who invited him to their constituencies keep their jobs as mps
i am losing count of how many times i have said and so it begins
there is no doubt that jobs will be at risk as a result of brexit that s the nature of political change i doubt there are any more at risk than would have been at risk if a 4 day week or a minimum 15 wage for mcdonalds staff was brought in and that s what labour promised
here we go be in no doubt brexit in any form will make our country poorer more impoverished worse of economically socially culturally is there a way to be clearer don t get distracted by anything else tumbles as brexit cliff edge fears grow
truth is brexit is history hasn t happened yet but it will do if it goes bad doesn t deliver the jobs we may have a chance if it goes well all our remain supporting mps must change or stand down
yes i am sure there will be some kind of deal but it will be far from what is hoped for and will not save many businesses and jobs brexit hope was to keep all that current trade with the eu and add on top of that wishful thinking
missed my two hour window to get my holiday money 
well that didn t take long leapords  spots
it was agreed that a no deal brexit wouldn t be back on the table as it puts so many jobs our nhs and even the environment in danger its a reckless and selfish move
such delusion johnson is vile and he keeps vile company and will merrily be putting a lot of front line services out of jobs plus taking us into no deal brexit in fact the damage has been done boristheliar notmypm
looks like johnson will press ahead with brexit with or without a deal by 31 12 20 maybe get a deal in name only so its done consequences will be in impact on uk business jobs and economy
welcome to hard brexit land either a v basic free trade deal on eu terms or an even harder wto border for dec 2020 uncertainty will continue  investment go elsewhere
now back to our scheduled programme brexit pound tumbles as brexit cliff edge fears grow
so much for get brexit done 2020 will be even more convulse than this year pound tumbles as brexit cliff edge fears grow
no jeremy corbyn did nothing to warn his voters of the catastrophic consequences of brexit and did nothing to stop it when he had the chance his jobs first brexit is as much to blame for the chaos and poverty that will ensue
this is reckless bravado rooted in the arrogant belief that the eu needs the uk more than the uk needs the eu it is boris johnson in a nutshell 
shall we blame this on jeremycorbyn as well wake up people smell the coffee this is what you voted for 
only somewhat abstract econ hit ask who labouriously documented the quarter of a million jobs already lost due to brexit it s the media who aren t doing their jobs citizen journalists are doing the work but it s not getting into nat l media
yet another cliff edge crisis is on the horizon  the markets have acted accordingly people elected bozo thinking he would bring an end to the brexit crisis the erg  tory donor cri pin odey will be over the moon with a no deal meltdown

hurrah
be an interesting journey not sure it can last past brexit unless they create jobs lots of jobs
boris says we ll leave eu with no deal brexit so he ll risk loss of jobs after just 4 days in power remember he said this i m humbled and vow to repay your trust boristheliar karma voting for boris you lose your job  your nhsforsale i ll keep saying told you so
i ve had 150 in cash stashed under one of my turntables since march 2017 and my entire understanding of brexit in economic terms is pretty much based on whether it s worth more or less since the last thing boris came out with and boy it s a rollercoaster
so rather than doing the responsible thing and safeguarding jobs and our economy is willing to weaken his negotiating position and gift 1 2 the country anxiety for christmas shit brexit
boris johnson says he ll make it illegal to extend the brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020 the prime minister s been speaking as mps return to work later one of their first jobs will be to pass boris johnson s withdrawal agreement
relatively strong labour market and only somewhat abstract econ hit from brexit probably the reason here though won t last if there s a more direct impact on jobs living standards though imo
brexit will be a disaster there us no jobs bonanza the deindustrialised areas will continue to be so and descend into more despair as the tory fire rips whatever is left off keynesianism is needed but instead we have the sociopathic friedmanites in charge
brexit once it actually happens btw they think that it already has and it s easy people will actually lose jobs houses lives
so that s that we no deal dec 2020 i don t want brexit to be an abject failure i want people to have jobs our nhs to function for the next generation to have opportunities aplenty what s the incentive for businesses to stay here they want the single market
but a helpful headline if you are looking to assist your currency trading mates
people who rely on welfare state jobs in car manufacturing and business which rely on the eu market have lost we lost when corbyn was re elected and did well enough in ge17 to cling on to ensure brexit if he d not been leader corbyn would ve helped johnson like gisella did
what happens if brexit boosts this country s economy business and boost jobs will you or any remainer feel any guilt in being one who stopped it and we all know you wont answer this
is that the sound of a recession we re all going to have to tighten our belts and the government will have to re think its spending pledges
what happens if theres a boost to jobs and you are one who blocked brexit the ones who blocked the increase of jobs and the growth of the country will you feel guilt of course you wont because you simply dont care

hey you dirty middle class remainers we should have let the tories get away with their brexit scam never fought for a peoples vote and never stood up for those traitor eu nationals coming over here and stealing all those professional jobs from the white working class
please note that corbyn mcdonnell manifesto had correct  vital economic incl brexit policy 2address neglectd north post industrial towns compard2decades of previous failure incl british jobs british workers
the brexit dividend many of the 300 thousand in spain for exle voted to achieve this a small sacrifice compared to the dwindling jobs market
you can see it all over the north east especially in sunderland where thousands of jobs at nissan are at real risk because of brexit support for brexit has hardly shifted at all in three years no matter how many times the risks are pointed out
the only good thing is that the libdems brexit  centrist meps will lose their jobs  poorly represented in parliament too we should now ride the storm
brexit will not deliver jobs for the north if for anyone outside the financial sector so next election is ble whoever leads
as ever it s judge us on what we tell you not what we do build the hospitals create the nurse and police jobs deliver brexit while making households richer off you go
or we could go back further if labour had explained to its heartlands why brexit was really bad for them if labour had after the referendum immediately come out in favour of respect the ref but don t destroy jobs economy gt sm and so on
the argument is that corbyn spent three years wibbling about a jobs first brexit thus lending credibility to brexit in general when he could have been tearing into tory brexit as it is he left the field wide open to tory brexit propaganda
i think offering everyone free education a better nhs better schooling 1000 s of green jobs is speaking to the heartlands the simple fact is they wanted brexit done and opportunists seized on that
no you re not alone it hurts because we know that the tories are going to make everything worse brexit will be a disaster the nhs will fall intotrump s hands prices of essential medicines will rise  jobs will be lost as businesses relocate to eu more lies from liarjohnson
i may point out that before the election i believed in a 2nd eu ref on leadership we need a strong woman working class voice that will push for cross party efforts on a brexit deal that will protect jobs hopefully angela rayner or rebecca long bailey
the labour leadership didn t even have the motivation to explain that brexit would have adverse consequences they were trying to promote their own so called jobs first lexit
sunderland though had car workers there i think the argument that a softer brexit would safeguard their jobs so voted labour
someone on the left said that you were one of the good ones there is no story here apart from hard working people losing their jobs fairer coverage would have helped them more stop shit stirring and head to where the real story is get brexit done the reality
oh really so they should do what fartage says then because he doesn t like this brexit should they do what hannan said and not threaten our place in the single market did they vote to lose their jobs or did 52 not really vote for the same thing but c 100 different things
why add your views and spin to the message to deliver a brexit that guarantees a close economic partnership with the eu and protects british jobs and businesses build a partnership as sovereign equals thats what the pm has said
we don t want to see delusion like our brexit will be better make us richer save all jobs because it s patently untrue we want a return to the zero tolerance on all forms of bigotry we want to see labour embrace the other parties instead of being exceptionalist
maybe if jobs don t follow brexit they may forgive even accept a mostly remain party election
in the spirit of healing i think you should give a job in your social justice department if she s willing to stomach a hard brexit i don t think even she realises that they want right out of the eu jobs or no jobs they expect the govt to
with hindsight 1 sticking with the referendum results 2 negotiate a soft brexit good for jobs and the gfa remainers hope for a ppl vote could ve been brought to parliament through petition but should nt have been as part of the labour manifesto
oh how wonderful thank you for staying relevant in your caign on such topics as the economy jobs the immigration crisis trade relations foreign relations brexit and most important for you health care this endorsement hits so many of these critical national issues
completely ignoring her collusion with the tories an failing to clearly explain the the way brexit will rob doncaster of jobs
corbyn is an antisemite as are his supporters brexit or not the country is not interested in marxist nut jobs
yeah the jobs sort of done regarding keeping labour out not convinced boris will take us out properly though and i was really gutted the brexit party never won a seat i went to rallies and was convinced we would have brexit party mp s this time i wanted the sw draining
this whole statement is an oxymoron boris and moral for starters then a brexit which protects british jobs and businesses oh please
how long now before the brexit jobs bonanza
brexit foreigners flooding this country taking our jobs out of control these were reasons i heard from many unfortunately this  treachery inside lp against their leader aided abetted by media  as liars allowed boris back
i know i now hope all of them lose their jobs when the industry collapses and the country breaks up i tried long enough to fight brexit and the tories now i want the hardest brexit possible so it hurts them badly i know i won t suffer as i m looking for a job in eu
as the election analysis kicks in in full force i hope labour voices don t castigate mps who fought despite having leave voting seats to see off a no deal brexit which no one actually voted for it was brave and principled  it sought to save thousands of local jobs
not only is this tory administration promising it can clean up the mess started by its immediate tory predecessors brexit but also now paying attention to neglected north in large part denuded of jobs  purpose by 80s tory govts
7 liam labour lost a because from the outset of brexit the leadership has been totally divorced from the people who go the work who need jobs to live  keep a roof over their heads labour leadership has been sat on the tory benches 8
so why do they feel brexit is more important to them than bread and butter issues such as jobs nhs education and security dont get why europe is viewed as a malevolent thing by people
true but there was anger about brexit in this lab stronghold oxford e bmw may pull out with huge loss of jobs  the universities big employers face losses many thought leave s caign was racist  they had cheated not easy to convince people to accept the ref result
genuine question how many trade deals have you got ready for 31st january brexit day so millions don t need to lose there jobs and businesses don t need to fail due to huge trading tariffs marr ridge
3 liam please tell me how a political party with the aim of support for the people especially the workforce decided to support brexit liam every impact statement has been clear there is no form of brexit which does not impact on jobs  workers please this is nonsensical
anyway long winded explanation that nobody will listen to which means it s a waste of time really but maybe labour s problem isn t it was brexit wot done it but rather we didnae feed the weans didnae protect abused women and didnae give jobs to people for decades
the best option was original plan respect the result negotiate a jobs brexit the trap was laid by  blair with the bigger aim of taking back the party people like yourself mucked in oblivious
in what way did you envisage a labour brexit being able to protect jobs and rights
well one way to help job creation is to start moving forward with the eu exit because for the past 4 years there has been a large slow down in new jobs because of the uncertainty of brexit getting out with a deal will create new job opportunities from the eu and overseas
i hope the uk pulls out of the eu so i can see these brexit supporters lose their jobs
i maintain we should have developed our jobs first brexit with a detailed regional investment plan along with benefits for a largely popular domestic agenda position but at least be clear on what we wanted clarity is the first thing needed as we were on say austerity
arguing for a labour brexit would have been utterly pointless there is literally no such thing as a brexit which projects jobs and rights there is only one which is slightly less damaging to them they would then have lost at least as many votes to the lib dems if not more
i thought the point of brexit was to create jobs for british people what this country needs is to keep the nurses they have and either train some more here or let them come from wherever without restrictions then they must retain them so treat them well
labour need a strong remainer for the next leader the tories have to make brexit successful if they do by investing and bringing jobs to the working class leavers they ll win another landslide whoever labour choose if they don t labour need someone who opposed brexit
no because the problem is working class  everyone else buying foreign made goods then asking where all the jobs went those jobs won t return just because we leave the eu they might if drops enough but will it would we want that brexit generalelection electionresults
why do they believe brexit is the answer because of the daily media blasts telling them that this is the case because of 350 million a week more for the nhs scrawled on the side of a bus because of things like this pushed through their door threatening the jobs they have
labour s failure on brexit was corbyn milne s in 2016 they always wanted to leave so labour never wholeheartedly embraced explaining to the people why brexit would damage jobs and harm their future had they done that from the start they could ve taken the base with them
there isn t a brexit that protects jobs and businesses i think you know that you ve seen all the forecasts
not often i agree with caroline flint about something but as a remainer i think she s spot on a labour brexit protecting jobs and rights was overwhelmingly more palatable than the tory hard brexit that awaits us now may the universe protect us all from the coming storm
boris you have been trusted to get us a proper brexit one that befits the worlds 5th largest economy and one that has a trade deficit with the eu of 80 billion lots of eu jobs rely on u k custom do not be weak
we don t need a period of reflection we were holding our noses voting labour and we all know why brexit is a stupid idea explain to people why it s a stupid idea corbyns jobs brexit was bollox rid the party of momentum and the stalinist cabal jess angela yvette kier
no they want brexit they want fofm to end a customs union wouldn t have made any difference to them and might have actually helped to protect jobs

wait and see bojo will probably go for a soft brexit as he doesn t need either the dinosaur party from ni or the erg nut jobs now
brexit is those issues homes jobs economy and opertunity all better with less immigration and self control
i am not surprised his majority means he doesn t need the erg nut jobs and as he wasn t really a brexiteer only did it for personal advancement i suspect it will be a soft brexit because otherwise he wont be able to deliver on his election promises if at all
she s right when northern towns vote tory because they want change after 10 years of tory rule brexit and managed decline when they blame foreigners for the collapse of the nhs when large foreign companies leave for europe and their jobs are lost yeah they are thick
to be honest i an not going to move a muscle to help brexit succeed how can it i ll just take pleasure in all the northern brexit voters losing their jobs
if brexit was such a huge issue in the election why didn t spend 6 wks ripping johnsons hard brexit deal to shreds explaining in forensic detail the impact on jobs of coming out of the single market the impact on our rights on ni the environment the union
plenty of jobs going at costa coffee anna soubry shamed over brexit this is what happens when you tell 17 4m to f k off
may turned to the dup and erg for a harder brexit that would cost jobs and workers rights i started to support a second referendum to give people a chance to vote for what they wanted be it hard brexit soft brexit or remain that was in line with party policy as it evolved
agree i think the fallout of brexit over the years will cause a lot of discontent among leave voters who won t get what they were promised many sectors benefit massively from the protection of eu market a globalist brexit under boris will further gut jobs and quality of life
why a hard brexit will be devastating for jobs the economy and peoples lives she has a responsibility to defend her constituents does she not

we need to take our country back i voted for brexit all these foreigners taking our jobs coming to this country and taking council houses while others who are from here have been waiting for a council house for the longest
only way forward was what labour offered voters after the get brexit done ridiculous scenario and libdems remain stance only way to bring everyone together was to have a brexit that would safeguard jobs and trade rather than a hard brexit which we will get now
racism that s why was right deal with the brexit problem first then ge but decided to wreck everything no pv no caretaker gov no action plan for 2nd ref what do you think was going to happen the ge was about race not nhs poverty jobs
i m sure big capital and the panjandrum class will reward them all with thankyou jobs for their attempts to stop brexit to an investment bank to the bma or nice etc how it works sadly

brexit and when they discover that they have been sold unicorn farts and that the reason they are poor have no jobs etc is nothing to do with the eu and everything to do with the inherent tory hatred of the north they will regret their decision
no she supported a soft brexit that would protect workers rights jobs and economy whilst leaving eu it would mean we would have a trade deal not years of uncertainty and that we wouldn t be dictated too by america who what to bleed britain dry votelabour nandy4leader
whether the labour party likes it or not more votes were cast for 2nd ref remain parties than for johnsons brexit should have joined the winning team the northern brexiteers actually don t want the glorious manifesto they want jobs outside of pits  factories for their kids
voted for a soft brexit which protects workers rights jobs and economy whilst leaving eu you were ok with that at first john but now you support boris johnson
i am sure it will still happen but it will so much more difficult my son already told he may have to come home this year and jobs won t be the same next year
labours economic policies have always been quite popular i ve not said they aren t this was lost from labour on brexit and immigration urbanites don t seem to understand that immigration to these villages and towns effects them negatively jobs services school places etc

the fact that he peddled it as jobs first did more to validate the idea of brexit than the tories ever could and pushed the overton window towards no deal not one job lost was as big a lie as the tories ever told as was a deal that wouldn t have passed the 6 tests
it s not just the jobs though it s all the eu agencies esa eumetsat eumet the list goes on we ve been pushing the uk as the place for space technology and we then leave the esa trump is in the process of breaking the wto and there is no way we can do eu deals in 1 year

it seems that they have played on people and painted immigrants as some bogey man coming over to take your jobs i mean a lot of pro brexit supporters are racist so that plays into this then it s a generation thing too a lot of the older generation voted brexit
trouble is even if people lose their jobs will that be enough for them to decide electing johnson was a bad idea will people switch again will they have someone to switch to even if economy is bad will they blame the right person johnson or will they say brexit is patriotic
gosh you are really well informed on the positions of new tory intake better than i am but fears about jobs  local pressures on new mps will emerge as boring brexit talks progress next year always said brexit wd split both parties  it is starting to do so

don t be fooled into believing the collapse of the red wall was a vote for brexit it was not it was a vote against corbyn the traditional working class so called are not socialists they want rights and protections jobs and prosperity but they are small c conservatives
the brexit party gave labour leavers somewhere to go without voting tory corbyn gave them nothing indeed his policies would cost them their jobs
yeah waiting for a situation to explode that involves people jobs and livelihoods is a smidge on brand here
but you assume all working class people don t want to remain many gig economy workers many young some with degrees work in shitty underpaid jobs and do not want brexit or patriotism the working class is not just white folk in the red wall
you didn t get the message yet you were the best thing tories wished for you gave them a nice majority a hard brexit and thousands of jobs will be lost you could avoid it but you had to have a try at being pm no matter what that s the price you made the uk pay for your ego
i know and it fucks me off because the people in this city are so focused on brexit that they ignore all the tory policies that will directly damage their lives and jobs
remainers are remainers because brexit will be an economic and social catastrophe jobs gone racism enabled so it s not a negotiable position even corbyn going for norway deal would have helped anyway we will find out arguing is pointless history will not be listening now
the stuff about brexit was worrying should labour adopt policies based on uneducated peoples opinion or educate them which is more important getting their votes based on emotional class misconceptions or protecting their long term economic security jobs rights
religious studies and the phases f the moon i m going for going to university to so he can tell the grandkids he was a success in education won t mention the debt or the fact he ended up working in a call centre due to lack of jobs cos of tory asset stripping and brexitwhere it does exist it tends to do so in total isolation from the rest of the community sunderland voted for a brexit that will destroy the one source of good jobs in the area because the rest of the community could not imagine what a good job is
the day after the referendum i was targeted with homophobic poofs like you will be next abuse 10 000 abusive tweets within 24 hrs the police were informed i had to shut down my twitter account i lost two jobs in germany the next week because they would overlap with brexit

understanding not division the focus should have turned to those areas that voted for brexit and their real concerns addressed the money spent in the last 3yr on brexit should perhaps have been used on the infrastructure health services and jobs in those areas and on people
are you suggesting we shouldn t surely that s the one of the reasons behind brexit we control our immigration not be told by others who to accept doesn t matter where immigrants come from if they re up to the jobs we need them for everyone s a winner
when you collude with democracy deniers you should know the british remember and never forgive and are both out of jobs sacked by the electorate because they tried to overturn brexit learn the lesson
as much as i like the green new deal this needs to be conveyed in terms that connect with working class voters tell them it will bring 1000s of secure well paid jobs our manifesto was visionary but ahead of its time we needed simpler messages and not to deny brexit

number one promise shoved under the 350 million bus on day 3 of the new government will the announce this yeh but we want brexit done mate fuck them foreigners they can fuck off taking our jobs
no not have to face facts if we want to go foreward the people decided that they wanted a brexit at all costs even if means that they lose their jobs and their children s prospects are reduced i heard interviews with people in the north unbelivable
but as far as i can tell some people seem to think that s ok as long as the people impacted are not them it doesn t matter if other people die lose their jobs are maimed as long as it doesn t happen to me

literally the whole election was based on brexit and it just shows how racist the country is because they think if brexit is done all the immigrants who are taking their jobs will have to leave

it s incredible people voting for brexit when their jobs are dependent on being in the eu others voting for anti immigration parties when their partners are immigrants you can t cure stupid
jeremy corbyn was not a radical left wing gov socialist adjacent yes but overall he wanted to infuse those dead high streets in crippling towns with jobs  a green industrial revolution they said no thanks we want want brexit generalelection
before the referendum i said that no matter how bad brexit gets no matter how much damage to the economy jobs people s livelihoods  trade brexiters will never admit it was brexit i hate being right

jeremycorbyn because of you idiots an th farce of brexit i broke my wrist an arm yesterday voting get on with your jobs
and the people voting brexit are the british that complain about people stealing their jobs but the jobs include picking trash and cleaning toilets sorry but i m pretty sure the british wouldn t want to do these so why brexit i still don t understand
had a chat with a friend tonight her nz born sister a long term uk resident phd academic voted conservative to get brexit done and stop the flood of polish coming and taking our jobs sorry this propaganda sh t seems to work a treat actually
what we must do is demand is that fiuncane start to deliver for the unionist people in north belfast we are watching you finucane i demand he starts delivering on the lack of housing in unionist areas of north belfast jobs health education and stop johnston bad brexit deal
no they don t care have you not seen any of the interviews with older people saying that members of their families losing their jobs is a sacrifice worth it to get brexit
that seems to be the case and they have learned nothing this time round they cannot say we didn t know they knew they were lied to they knew they voted against their jobs by supporting brexit may they now experience the consequences of their stupidity

hahahaha remainers are the losers brexit will happen move to scotland go ahead enjoy life on the dole up there not many jobs up there indyrep2 how that going to happen snp have no friends in the torries they backed labour
seems like its official the uk is a one party state we have politicians who refuse to be honest people have spoken cons promised brexit ref  prom to carry out result regardless of consequences to uk economy jobs etc that s what we are going to get
there are multiple factors here low skilled class thinks polish etc steal their jobs and their economic well being is dependent on brexit the center left or left thinks brexit would close down uk eco socially hammering pop narrative convinced lab class to vote p s i luv corbyn
brexit will force companies to offshore more jobs and will increase debt its a right wing project to dismantle regulation and social protections
and create even more jobs they believe eu contribution funds will be ploughed into the nhs thereby solving the current crisis in short they believe every major problem the country faces right now can be resolved by brexit that said
they truly believe that brexit will deliver a crock of gold that their areas will receive more investment from money saved by not paying into the eu they believe more jobs will be around due to stricter immigration controls they believe industries like fishing will recover
would brexit help w offshoring of jobs debt why is it such an important issue still
because he wouldn t tell the truth he should have caigned in why brexit was wrong why it would destroy jobs why it will destroy rights no one on either side leave it remain could trust him he was weak and dishonest
thought for the day now it s all over with nothing really changed other than brexit with an end in sight how about we let our hardworking nurses teachers and police do their jobs in peace without using them as political pawns and see what happens over the next 12 months
let brexit happens then see all those indian will start moving to european countries to safeguard their jobs and business indians are there to make money and after brexit they will find difficult to run their business in uk
basically low skilled workers are afraid that immigrants are gonna take their jobs so they voted for brexit basically over better quality of life
the uk will be fine are they the party for the job probably not but it will give the country some clearence on brexit which is good for business which in turn is good for jobs hence why the pound has strengthened now they have to live up to their promises i didn t vote them
many have been fed the idea that the counties problems homelessness nhs jobs etc are caused by immigrants and that brexit will solve this don t underestimate how most of britain feels about immigrants and those that don t look like them
when will people understand brexit is not about bloody foreigners coming over here taking our jobs it s about bloody foreigners coming over here taking our jobs for such a low wage you would if you could minimumwage is too low to live on rightwing
i think when people lose their jobs get sick  there s no free nhs lose their homes etc then it will sink in but it will be too late because they got brexit done i really wanted to swear here but i won t
good news 49 days until the brexit meps lose their jobs
i have a lot of respect for you but your stance on brexit has cost the election you ve let a lot of people down and cost people their jobs what hurts the most is that you knew it was going to happen generalelection ge2019
and that complacency had a large part to play in why those labour voters believed brexit would solve their problems problems which were to do with austerity and also the void left with collapse of traditional manufacturing jobs
despite brexit  corbyn s unpopularity shocked so many northern seats voted for a manifesto with 5 more years of austerity only positive is tories will find excuses for failures harder to make on jobs nhs brexit scotland but that won t help those suffering under austerity
well the working classes helped to vote in a right wing tory gov they have voted their own misery poss bec they think brexit will bring jobs but it won t cannot fathom who anybody some people vote for the tories but looks like england voted in droves for them fools
i think it s a mix of things for many ppl brexit is a vote for nhs they believe the bus slogan about more money and get rid of foreigners less ppl to take care of more resources jobs don t underestimate the london bridge attack the bumbling isn t he funny effect lying
one of the saddest seats we didn t get was so hoping he richard and anne got in but if we get the brexit nigel has fought and created then they did their jobs they made us proud as punch even without getting their seats and showed tories how it should be done
this is a key point as for all flints pro brexit voting it didn t help her labours manifesto was laughed at and corbyn had a very bad caign suffered badly through not tackling the anti semitism message should have been simpler nhs jobs investment food banks etc
haha bodo la brits ni voted for brexit whereas your millennials are useless fucks who do not have the right qualifications to get better jobs but believing that brexit would bring more opportunities to them lols
yeah english fisheries will be revived and manufacturing jobs will come flooding back to the uk after brexit what could possibly go wrong
it s brexit if you re working class and there s been no increase in minimum pay for x years and economic migrants are filling the jobs and taking housing they ve every right to react
remain mps who lost their jobs got what they deserved for ignoring the democratic vote what goes around certainly came around with a brexit bang
and how many of these people did you explain to about the impact brexit will have is already having on jobs investment the nhs employment rights etc did they all say that s okay won t be me i ll make those sacrifices
this man who wants forced labour cs actually somehow won his seat last night for ashfield now i am against calling all tories scum because some will honestly think brexit may be best for them jobs but for anyone who voted for this nazi i am saddened and disgusted by you
why other people s jobs why do you presume my job isn t affected ultimately far fewer jobs would have been sacrificed sadly absolutely zero ppl i spoke to on the doorsteps in the north mentioned the risk of brexit to the their jobs they just wanted it done
so with lots of smart caigning about risks to jobs food standards  union johnson might take easy path to a very soft brexit and get on with building bridges and railways and airports 3
as a citizen of the eu myself i ask that you do not give the uk not even a single day extension let them have a hard brexit  drown in the misery they brought upon themselves no jobs in eu for them  get their citizens out let trump save their soul
let s hope boris johnson manages to negotiate a brexit that isn t too harmful to jobs holds the union together and protects the eu citizens that have made the u k their home hopefully the divisive rhetoric of the caign will cease
these wins just in one day plus brexit won we know now it was all political period all the dems condemned all day but trump took out his magic wand  abracadabra changed to more jobs money china usmca stock market ext more winning as promised impeach that
that is the point no one is fixing the issue about people getting poorer declining mobility no jobs more austerity less gdp when brexit happensthe problem was this brexit was the focus not the election it sucks so bad googling teaching jobs and house prices in toronto
we as a party must show we truly are the people s party and continue to ensure the north gets a fairer share and above all brexit is brexit not a soft clinging to eu coat tails but a clean break protecting things like jobs fishing rights the nhs and n ireland
marry in haste repent at your leisure tories will push brexit thru with a 50 seat maj won with 44 of vote brexit will make us all poorer risk jobs when the brexit scales fall from the eyes of voters that switched to tories they ll have the rest of their lives to regret it
congratulations boris you aren t my choice and i m a remainer but cabinet change sign up to a soft eu trade deal that protects jobs give the finger to the ultra right nutters you ve had to tolerate and let s get brexit done then keep your word on spending ã£â€šã¥â¡
the man donated a years salary to the people in his constituency wonder if they ll give a thought to dennis in a years time when brexit still isn t done and thousands of jobs in the area are lost
thank you how many jobs have you created in the uk over the last decade how many do you think you can create after brexit in december 2020 i have created many fortunately and given opportunities to many young people especially and you
it s a case of bye bye to nissan in sunderland  toyota in derby to add to the loss of honda in swindon add in the loss of large numbers of jobs in the big pharma  agriculture sectors just for starters btw brexit completion will take another 3 4 years to achieve enjoy it
he was money men s puppet he did nothing for the working people he termed those living between ny  sf as flyovers such was his concern trump has brought many businesses into govt project  created thousands of jobs he scares the crud out of democrats really good man
do you think the blue collar tories will fill the jobs gap in agriculture and tourism after brexit
i will never align with those wanting q full leave wto brexit sell our to usu russia saudi isreal and other despotic regimes any ex labour who did deserve losss of jobs houses families and anything else
and you were one of the least trustworthy too focused on holding onto your comfortable expense fuelled westminster lifestyle instead of telling your constituents the truth about what brexit  a nasty altright neofascist tory government will mean for their jobs
any jobs going for a film business literate brexit refugee patrick anybody
no farage and boris johnson have insulted eu citizens and leaders in various occaisions and labour wanted a racist jobs first brexit what s not true
on the upside all those brexit meps will loose their jobs that includes farage on the downside so will meps who have worked their socks off a shout out to excellent politicians they do exist
the nouvelle northern tories tnnt deliver the biggest conservative win since thatcher well that one went well eh lads and lasses you have your oven ready brexit fine now what no eu to blame perhaps blame those who tried to save nhs socialcare jobs and communities
jobs fucked but with a majority we can make them work when brexit is out of the picture all these issues will come to the center of debate with no resolution make a change x
i was in ireland  scotland in 2015 i was impressed with what i saw of eu influence i met people from all over europe working in jobs i bet locals didn t want when brexit came about i couldn t understand the uk wanting to leave the eu probably because i m a liberal democrat
just to get brexit done a brexit that will likely massively impact our economy and alot of peoples jobs when trade is impacted food fuel will go up the nhs will likely be sold off now where get further in bed with a dangerously led usa it s a disaster
recpress after the conservatives victory the new government must now focus on stability investment and growth in our economy nodeal brexit would be disastrous for jobs and must not be allowed to happen recneil s full response
i would ve loved to stop brexit but i respected the result having another vote on an actual deal isn t undemocratic protecting jobs rights and trade is right now we ll have a no deal where no one is protected and the rich get richer austerity is the cause of decline congrats
their decision was wrong the workers in northern england are not going to magically get jobs again due to brexit as flawed as ramaphoria
these foreigners are taking all our jobs brexit kmt when the reality is they just don t like to do hard work they love to complain they want things brought to them on a silver platter and man will they get a rude awakening
all the people who vote tory or brexit party cause the foreigners are taking our jobs
i suspect many nurses are now applying for jobs in tesco mcdonalds argos ect por people have been let down by selfish fucks brexit how the fuck is that more important than stopping kids taking their own lives you pathetic fucks
one of the main reasons conservative won was the brexit impact idiots think brexit will mean less immigrants taking their jobs therefore they voted conservatives some muslims must ve voted tory cause they are idiots who are rich and would rather not pay their extra taxes
the stock market is up on a borisbounce brexit will happen now but no one knows what that will mean in real terms jobs econ growth businesses incomes property values we will all have to recalibrate our expectations recast our plans but not review our politics yet
people are sick of london sick of getting the money the glory the limelight the jobs the technology the travel centrist or centre right remainers proving what s more important wealth retention it was never about brexit for these people a disingenuous caign which
many of the voters of the so called unionist parties may vote for independence if given a choice only a few percentage points needed if polls are believed wait for misery of johnson s tory brexit kicks in medical supplies jobs just wait for it
make our country great again england brexit means brexit england get all those immigrants out england they re taking all our jobs england we won the war england i m now fully behind indyref2 scotland need to bail while they can
doesn t work does it thats why snell had no traction with me brexit that protects jobs etc
i think many are blinded by the get brexit done and no more migrants taking their job that s why they voted personally we need everyone to make britain great again from everywhere i have seen first hand british ppl turn jobs down as it below them  they get more on benefits
brexit is just beginning watch our priorities change from climate change and repairing our environment to fighting to keep our jobs and stop people dying from lack of access to health and social care
3 he d deliver brexit and be able to move onto other things the quickest way possible he d preserve more uk jobs and security and quite possibly head off scottish independence and irish reunification

after the victory the new government must now focus on stability investment and growth in our economy nodeal brexit would be disastrous for jobs and must not be allowed to happen full response
you can t blame the media for labour choosing a dithering old man with his racist jobs first brexit to represent them he lost against may and johnson and should be thoroughly ashamed
it seems a jobs first brexit wasn t for these three clowns
jeremy corbyn never cared for all he threw the eu citizens in uk with his racist jobs first brexit under a bus and the same with the british citizens in eu
corbyn is hanging around in order to make sure that the labour party doesn t change direction the unions want to make sure that they ll benefit from jobs created from large infratructure projects by the tories don t forget that the unions want brexit corbynout corbynresign
i should add that spaffing in about brexit won t work anymore the wa will pass again and we ll spend the next few years negotiating a comprehensive arrangement with the eu the uk needs good governance on everything else  folk like gauke are good at their jobs
no he s racist in general he doesn t give a shit about the working class people though or jobs or poverty or schools children the older generation only voted tories for brexit they won t be laughing when they can t even get treated at hospital due to not having the money
lots of people in brexit voting areas are still believing the lies and punishing labour it s their prerogative but with fewer jobs and no increase to benefits system workhouses might be the way forward frightening
the same way we saw the minorities voting brexit so bro kwame and femi can get the cleaning jobs without dimitri taking over each to their own
absolutely gutted that you didn t win last night david you ve been a brilliant mp for delyn constituency for many years it s shocking how many people want brexit more than they actually care about people the nhs jobs and the other important issues
if labour had anyone credible as leader  in the top jobs actually had believable manifesto promises rather than pipe dreams  fairytales brexit not brexit who knows then perhaps the people would have voted differently but the truth is people saw through their credibility
currently thinking about how much my dad sacrificed to come to this country how many jobs he s lost because of brexit how he s only just received an offer for a stable job after 2 years and for what

if you voted for them because of brexit you realise that wont fix anything right all it will do is increase tax for everything we get from europe which is a lot or are you just scared of all the scary foreigner coming in and stealing all the jobs that you won t fucking do
sad fact is working class ppl voted tory to get brexit done why brexit no jobs no money no future why no work  no chance of a future for the working classes simple one word answer thatcher in short the working classes have elected their own executioners
can t wait for all the people down the job centre to become doctors and ceo s and shit now that boris is going to get brexit done and get rid of all the immigrants who ve taken their jobs
to those who voted to get brexit done watch out i am a foreigner i will take all your jobs and steal your husbands i will seduce your wives and feed your children sugar your roses your good china your royal family memorabilia that s what i m after you dimwits
yeh creating more jobs after the great chance of losing many when boris makes his no deal brexit and trades with other countries we all know what other countries would pay good money for that we have the ignorance the party has to the basic issues effecting people is worrying

i m still not sure what the labour policy was on brexit i kept getting told that it was very clear and was a brexit for jobs though
i mean brexit is build on a foundation of hate and racism many immigrants have to fear for their jobs their homes and their families it s not about the eu exit per se it s about a more conservative direction of government hurtful to many minority groups 1 2
background took jobs in tufton st and right wing press to learn the operation watched them create brexit each word from offshore billionaires now im ready to talk to anyone who wants to listen only working together can we change this democracydieswithlies reclaimuk
the economic outlook put forward by eminent think tanks such as the london school of economics is a reduction of 2 9 of gdp because of brexit and we will still be trying to make trade deals at the next election when a lot of people will have lost their jobs my prediction

matt congratulations on your re election to parliament  to represent west suffolk also to to deliver on his word to deliver brexit then invest in our towns communities to boost our quality of life economy  jobs stillwaitingformyknighthood
of course normal people are just continually banging on about jeremy anti semitism and palestinian rights the nhs poverty brexit food banks jobs etc never get a look in i think you need to get out more mate and start looking at life through a different lens
possibly if he pivoted to accepting brexit is happening i mean it is and presents himself as the person who will fight to protect jobs communities funding and so on i don t think it is impossible to reconcile it all
the brexit issue though is just a cypher for the broader changes in society the destruction of working class identity jobs  communities over the last 40 years that have enabled such a dramatic shift labour it s members  supporters need to listen before rebuilding
not just that of course it should ve been about compassion for others for the disabled etc etc foodbanks will now increase no eu money for infrastructure development  jobs so potholes will increase not one of the torycandidate s pledges will be honoured bar brexit
oh rachel i thought you were smart real smart but now i m beginning to think you re a one trick pony do you realise how many companies jobs are in britain because it ticks so many boxes with in the eu being one of the biggest a no deal brexit would untick another few boxes
corbyn would have been terrible for the country all his free stuff has to come from somewhere which means more taxes less jobs slower growth etc all with more uncertainty over brexit as well shitty situation but corbyn would have been far worse imo
what is it about elmo photo bombing boris that makes me chuckle good on you uk hold the bastards accountable brexit means exit not cushy jobs for people with no skills who feather their nests at the eu
well brexiteers you have your wish voting for the dark side or not labour if any jobs are to go it should be put in stone that who voted for brexit should lose their jobs first and then you will realise what you have done
well done britain you will have your precious brexit well not really as there will be a deal that isnt really brexit but i suppose some of you are to small minded to actually realise that at least we can keep those bloody foreigners out from taking our jobs that the main thing
a lot of people in bridgend really enthusiastic about losing their jobs post brexit apparently
all i m hearing is get brexit done well good luck to everyone when brexit is over we will be left with hardly any nurses doctors etc because guess what majority of those workers are immigrants but obviously it s their fault because they are stealing our jobs
lot of people on here hoping tory brexit voters lose their jobs fall ill etc so they can rue what they voted for i don t want that i hope we can get through these next 5 years with minimal casualties i don t want to shake my head  say i told you so i want us all to be ok
actually i blame him for past 3 yrs not exposing all brexit lies but repeating many of them incl that a jobs first lexit was possible or that his negotiations would make lexit less of a disaster
so there we are hello brexit bye bye eu hello trump bye bye nhs hello isolation bye bye global britain hello deregulation bye bye jobs hello little england bye bye uk
creation of jobs means nothing when you take away thousands those wanting to go into areas of healthcare travel economics retail because i don t doubt consumer goods will struggle under an unstable economy the majority of people do not benefit from a brexit deal
then it s now down to london to tame mod spending and offer regional genuine jobs especially for ignored often bright women who voted brexit due to corporates creaming jobs with roosevelt ideas work programme one family only a man a job
interesting really given you failed to explain the impact you supported johnson and the tory brexit plan that will devastate barnsley but as i said before at least you have a job sorry two jobs as for leader you are not which is a shame dan
voting imho the issue was the labour manifesto mass nationalisation with no clear way to pay the youth aren t just people with no jobs and prospects as is often presented many are intelligent thoughtful and are shaping our future the election wasn t just about brexit
the general consensus is that it was brexit that done it let us not forget to the main driver behind brexit was the obsession with others poles taking jobs or foreigners making uk rules dog whistles during the caign landed on fertile ground daft cannot substitute nasty
jobs first brexit all the market none of the politics
personally i think if labour would of created more jobs in nhs they wouldn t of been looking after our own all corbyn needed to do was promise brexit but that s just my opinion
hi dont loose heart its just beginning get more on tv as a party if labour idiots do so can brexit people there will be plenty of opportunity all over the place including the withdrawal document also putting the right people in right jobs for the long haul stay
so we now have a prime minister that is a serial liar fired twice from jobs due to lies nhs brexit bus 350m etc is racist is homophobic is incredibly out of touch with working class supports the bankers  big corporations what a horrendous time to be british
corbyn and mcdonnell parroted this too though brexit for jobs was their line that dogwhistle isn t even a dogwhistle they re culpable in this
people said brexit would have an impact on jobs the dodds family lost two last night thoughts and prayers

is it worth it 5 more years of children going cold and hungry 5 more years of people in full time jobs using food banks rising homelessness cuts cuts and more cuts climate crisis but yay brexit is that really the biggest issue here where is your humanity ge2019
go brexit party candidates can now go find jobs elsewhere they are no longer needed and rightly so
also genuine concerns on the strain it puts on things like housing traffic on the roads doctors hospitals jobs  benefits but they re too short sighted to consider those things plus you only have to look at what open borders has done to these eu countries that has them
the north didn t vote for tories wholesale they voted for the fucking brexit party causing seats to be lost for lab which just show show racist and thick people are up here if you think you re going to get jobs back in the north now you are fucking mistaken generalelection19
brexit is a lie that you ve all been gullible to believe in say goodbyenhs our lives have changed for the worst there are no trade deals we have nothing you ve left an uncertain world for you children and grandchildren because apparently immigrants were stealing your jobs

i duff my hat for nigerians our hospitality is unconditional an average american see foreigners as intruders who have come to take up their jobs and benefits same with the british esp against other eu nations reason why make america great again and brexit would sell

it s ashame that my working class constituency turned from labour to conservative and i strongly believe it s only because of brexit aka racism aka the immigrants r taking our jobs so congrats once uve got ur brexit we ll be left wirh a tory government for another 5 yrs
you can tell yourself labour would have saved this with a jobs first brexit platform if you like but we all know it s nonsense and it s been nonsense for years
labour had no chance at all at the face of it the conservatives preached policies which favour the britons they promise to deliver brexit to them and lock out foreigners who took away their jobs etc the reality though is very trick and only time will tell

one factor in erg s dominance was how many young mps regarded it a better career move than backing may post 2017 2019 intake may have hardened on brexit but they also presumably want jobs which bill cash cannot offer

they were told the reason they have no jobs and food is the eu and not the tory gvt now boris has the excuse to do whatever he wishes saying you wanted brexit at all cost i deliver it the ones who voted for brexit didn t realize they open

this is part one now we have to make sure the conservatives deliver on the promise to get brexit done leave them to it and risk it all again keep the pressure on let them know we are watching and if and others value their jobs they won t betray us
he who laughs last laughs longest you ll be shedding tears of sorrow at having voted for the lunacy of brexit when you or your loved ones lose their jobs because employers move to eu where there are no trade tarrifs or barriers  profits are greater
indeed the conservatives now own brexit and it s consequences on the economy jobs  livelihoods
johnson now owns brexit whether he sells out his party base with a soft rule taker brexit or throws the economy under the bus and manufacturing jobs in his new seats with hard brexit he owns it all of it
well at least the brexit party meps will lose their jobs now cold comfort

i m genuinely confused either people think they are gonna get some lotto type payout following brexit or they have had enough of those foreign types taking their jobs and their wimin if that s not the case then they are confused if they think cons care about them

accept that s what we are as a country or hope views change i don t know but the policy of tony blair to open our borders may go some way to explaining the loss of working class votes in some labour areas they see brexit as closing those borders and helping secure their jobs
i think we need to accept the working class vote was about immigration with brexit being a symptom of that it s not racism as such but they perceived their problems to be about the flood of cheap labour coming into the country and taking jobs and using the nhs not sure how
all the brexit mob will be rejoicing this morning wait till it kicks in and people start losing their jobs can t get medicine and realise we are a third world economy you want it you got it

it s a betrayal of all the miners and steel workers who lost their jobs thanks to the tories all because of brexit which will make people worse off just cannot believe people have voted for the lying bafoon i thought the brexit vote was bad this is even worse
do you realise what tories have to do beyond brexit they have to satisfy northern voters with jobs impossible for them to do that since they ve only ever closed things down johnson over egged this
