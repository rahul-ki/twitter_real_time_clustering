The electorate radicalised into 30 No Deal  15 Revoke compared to the electorate being less certain on the Brexit outcome in 2017 That inevitably impacted on how the Parties reacted to it depending on their Remain Leave composition The Tories in the end had a simpler message
This will be an unpopular take with the folks who follow me really on a roll lately huh but all things considered given the circumstances this is good Can t change what s happened Maybe it s best we just let the Tories get Brexit done and fast so the country can move on

That s what they get for electing Tories Still they overwhelmingly want 2 make NHS stronger not dismantle it Even Tories make promises in that regard Brexit caign slogan was literally for the NHS Any1 who lives under single payer HC won t trade it for anything

Tories have majority now But it will need a high level of competence in the government to get the best for Britain Brexit always needed it majority government It also needs a strong competent one or risk getting a bit manipulated agreeing to some less attractive deals
But it was not the collective will in that sense Brexit distorted the election in England because a lot of working class voters were Leavers and lent their votes to the Tories to get Brexit done plus the Labour Party went too far left for them but they will not support more
That argument is over I m sorry It is good that it s the Tories that will have to deliver on the easiest trade deal in history It will be shit show like every other step in Brexit but it has to happen I d be in favour of not accepting a rejoin application from England

So much for getting Brexit done to stop us being ruled by unelected officials
Voters opted for the Tories instead of the Brexit Party Let s hope they re not disappointed in the months to come Boris should tear up the enforced Surrender Treaty keep the 39bn and just Leave on Jan 31st
Everyone complains when we say we call people who voted Tories unintelligent however it was Labour who wanted to end zero hour contracts Tories introduced it Tories won on getting out of the EU These blokes are more likely to end up on the streets than to be helped
Shock horror Tories not keeping to their promises never after all those people who just didn t like corbyn because everyone else had some shit excuse or none or some face they pulled when asked if they were voting Labour Hope he fucks it right up
The Tories vote went up less than 2 overall With the Brexit party they picked up just 335 000 votes Labour lost 2 5 million votes Nearly twice as many of these votes went to pro Remain parties than to the parties supporting Leave pissupinabrewery
The media is deliberately and studiously ignoring the fact that the Tories only won because Farage s plan worked but Farage hates Johnson s deal and so does most of the Brexit coalition GE2019 was not some victory for Tory ideology It was the Leave vote reasserting itself

Why would the Lib Dems pass over or bring down a Corbyn led minority govt in favour of a second election if a PV was on offer The Tories were never an option given their Brexit stance and the coalition experience Ergo in many a eyes a vote for Lib Dems was a vote for Corbyn 9
They clearly haven t realised that Labour introduced workers rights in respect of ZHC s due to huge companies taking advantage of their lack of rights The tories are now looking to scrap these rights and have more power to do so with Brexit and no EU Laws to adhere to plonkers

I actually think Starmer would absolutely destroy Johnson But is he just going to let the Blairites back in People say he s a Remainer and responsible for our Brexit policy But Brexit is now fully owned by Johnson  the Tories We ve gone through the Brexit door now
No Sarah Murphy the Tories won because they promised Brexit
It s good but he compares remain vs tories In leave seats the real issue was votes to Brexit party allowing tories through So false premise Rest is great though I think either fully remain or fully leave were ble d last of a wider strategy No political craft though
When you find out your sister who s on ESA voted for the Tories because of Brexit
Well I have woken up to a labour government in my lifetime and it felt bloody brilliant I want everyone I know to experience that I think brexit may be the downfall of the tories Forever
More votes went to remain people s vote parties than to the Tories and Brexit Party
No they weren t they were definitely going to put a soft brexit against remain in another referendum That s nothing like the brexit Tories it BP were offering
I mean the tories used brexit as a smokescreen to cover up their frankly pathetic domestic record
Critically as Brexit effects start to bite how will there be the money for Labour Heartlands reinvestment northern transport promises and of course NHS investment It won t be plain sailing for the Tories
ERM Brexit yes it is crazed experiment Boosting 92 then in the sense of freeing of fiscal shackles but we still had a kicking from a recession for 18 months My point was ERM was death of perceived economic competence in the Tories publicly Brexit bets UK on a horse at Kempton
No doubting Corbyn unpopular smears worked but that s not the whole story In lots of places Tory vote barely changed but lots of Lab leavers voted Brexit so Tories slipped through middle Don t get me wrong Brexit will fuck UK But Lab couldn t have won on Remain ticket
I don t dread the day as it s now inevitable we ll leave the EU by 31st January But our work is cut out more than ever as we watch what happens next like hawks Brexit was the Tories trump pun not intended card and the rest of the hand is not that brilliant Let play begin
Not everybody that voted Tories is a racist but many racists voted Tory And racists feel emboldened by the massive win like after the Brexit referendum I am a foreigner and I felt the nastiness and it s the same for British ethnic minorities They get it and we foreigners 2
Neither does Boris Boris like Trump is a fake patriot Clive is ex military  a decent man which may cut thru against such a phoney opponent Doesn t need 2 apologise 2 win against Boris he needs 2 stand his ground Doesn t matter what anyone voted on Brexit now Tories own it

Agreed but the Tories were very clear once voted in Brexit would be done ticktock
A vote for the lib Dems was just a way for remainers to get the Tories back into power without taking the blame personally for brexit
Brexit had nothing to do with Europe at all then I hope the Tories have a terrible time because they caused this
Well said Richard It was Brexit  the right wing billionaire owned media shielding the Tories from public scrutiny not holding them to account  spreading fake news against Labour that is the cause The current Labour policies are EXACTLY what our country needs Solidarity
Are you including the 600 k of people that voted Brexit party Or the thousands that voted for pro brexit independent candidates I think you ll find it s still more Tories and a tory gov even under a PR system albeit technically a hung parliament
And yet they ll keep voting for him because as long as they have a brown Mexican neighbour then they must be getting poorer Same story in the UK the Midlands voted for Tories and yet they will be hit the hardest with Brexit Lunatics
No comments on Brexit You don t say much for a speaker Are you happy that the tories won
Look Brexit is done now we have to concentrate on our home we have to attack the Tories at every level and hold them to account We need to have a strong cohesive message Learn from Cummings do a job back on them
Reeeeeaaaaally I think you ll find you are incorrect Even if we had a directly proportional representation system we would have a hung parliament with the tories still the largest party and the brexit party would have had 10 seats too
Britain did not elect a BJ government Tories would be 40 seats short of a majority without the 81 seats the electoral system gave them But those so keen on democracy wrt Brexit aren t bothered by this it seems
to get back into Government we need to expand beyond Labour voters we need former tories liberals and non voters a confusing Brexit position does not do this and many Remainers now support getting brexit done as they want it out of their lives this is reality
No but I think there were bigger issues affecting the whole party E g Brexit position media covering up for Tories so voters didn t believe Labour anti Corbyn media caigns  bias
Blaming the Lib Dems for Tory victory is like blaming democracy for Labour s downfall If the system FPTP cannot allow for plurality of views the system should be blamed and changed Lib Dems were the only sane option for anti Brexit voters stopfirst
Easy all Tories were unified behind Brexit and that was what the election was about They won because Labour brexiters and it didn t require many in each electorate voted Tory swinging the balance in Bojo s favour there was no unity of Labour and remain Easy
Nigel gave us Brexit Nigel gave us Boris Nigel gave Boris a majority Nigel won the election for the Tories Very different result without the Brexit Party standing and standing down where it did Handed it to Boris on a silver platter Indeed where is the thanks
So voting Lib Dem s has enabled a Tory Brexit and robbed Labour of seats it could have won increasingly the Tory majority There is no point in the Lib Dem s existing unless you are the Tories that is We don t need them in the Labour Party
The crushing defeat of the left was also caused by the Lib Dems splitting the vote As for the election being a second referendum on Brexit anti Brexit or 2nd referendum parties won more votes than did Johnson even assuming all Tories were pro Brexit
This disparity is because five parties supported remain while 2 1 2 parties because the Brexit party stood in just half the seats supported leave This is unfair because Tories were certainly going to win With many seats there were only two leave parties
Next GE wont be for at least 5 years In that time with such a strong majority Tories will truly own Brexit We need someone really forensic sensible and slick to fully hold them to account throughout for the inevitable cluster fuck and provide zero distraction for the media

The Tories can now move slightly to the left investing in Northern and Midlands towns reversing austerity etc but also do what we as a party will not get Brexit done control immigration and oppose identity politics That combination could keep Labour out for a generation
The problem is that the Tories are unlikely to give security to the poorest in society the ones who most need it It is all about empathy and resources and the Right often seem to lack both In this light Brexit will one day be seen as a national tragedy

The diehard unionists in UKLabour Scotland have come up with a splendid way of nullifying the GE result 43 for the Tories is not a mandate for Brexit if 45 is not a mandate for Indyref2 but refreshing to see other Labour figures accepting the democratic mandate for Indyref2
And I also see the racism coming from the working class people who rant about Brexit sovereignty and traitors love Farage call Labour hard left and Marxist and think the Tories will save them from the horrendous conditions caused by um the Tories

Let s face it Tories won as soon as Boris was able to marry the party to Brexit
so people who voted for brexit are bad and you wonder why Tories won the election
The Tories are totally bigoted and have been found guilty but not reported across the board They wanted Brexit So did those papers and media mentioned above Labour are racist How Some in the party are anti Semitic yes but than people are in all parties
If Brexit was about democracy why aren t people up in arms about the Tories apparent landslide due not to voters but to an electoral system that took 81 seats off other parties for them
In 5 years time it ll be the people who held the Tories to account on Brexit who we ll be using to win It s not like Brexit will be sunlit uplands in 5 years Labour are an opposition party they re not the cheerleading squad

There s an eejit on saying the Tories manipulated there to be a Brexit Seriously He really believes it
Then the Tories have less of a mandate for Brexit
still waiting for the blairites red tories and the zionists to apologise BREXIT ELECTION END OF
The lack of answers they seemed happy with indicates otherwise Not knowing what brexit entailed for them under the Tories wilful ignorance Out at any cost is what they asked for Funny they value democracy despite reading P48 and elected a racist classist sexists liar
They were at 26k this time slightly down But turn out was higher Maybe due to Leavers who don t usually vote coming out for Tories Rare to get Labour Labour switchers but have met a couple Soft Labour Brexit not perceived as real Brexit by some
I think that if going into the election both Labour and the Tories had the others policy on Brexit instead of the ones they did have it would be Corbyn as PM now and not Boris The last GE was really the second Brexit referendum
Already Broken promises are so worth it just to Get Brexit Done init Even though Brexit ain t getting done for a long while and he s gunna make sure we have a shit deal coz these selfish pigs don t give af about us Yet people chose the CONservatives the dirty Tories
Shame they were so hateful for so many centuries then forever changing the course of nations and races of people Now you have Brexit and the Tories giving racism and hate a voice they deem legitimate Hating on anyone and everyone not English Worse for those that aren t so
In remember the same being said about the Tory party after New Labour s landslide win Labour or some version of it will bounce back The pessimism is that folk who will be hardest hit by brexit  cared least for by the Tories voted for them but they ll never admit their errors
Dear this is on you Instead of going for an option of settling Brexit one way or another you facilitated the Tories Once again Please do enjoy the next elections This is to make no deal the default removing all blame from himself
Theres people at the end of their tether because of nine yrs of tories Real suffering For the Tories to fool these ppl into voting for them telling them they will get Brexit done as if that caused their hardship is contemptible and dangerous for democracy
Some people just can t swallow the disaster that is Brexit Like suicidal lemmings charging over the cliff those that see the cliff coming are staring in disbelief they re about to be pushed over the edge It s going to run it s course now the Tories have won
Labour is finished Also didn t you vote Brexit The Tories have been in charge for over 10 years nothing has ever been privatised or sold off we still get free healthcare
does brexit even exist or did the tories just make it up to get votes
Starmer with Thornberry as for Tories to deliver Brexit they only care about No Deal as Brexit is an oxymoron hence why Labour offered a ref Labour always had the solutions but Tories had bought  paid for Media Russian interference Trump et al
thought they wanted or would be maybe the LDs might be in a stronger position if brexit damages the Tories But Labour would also adapt it s position and policies I know there is alot of hope for a female leader but I think Starmer is the most uniting
You know what Those of us feeling like crap about Brexit and these racists here we really don t have it worse than so many people around the world And we definitely don t have it as bad as many periods of time in history So 5 10 more years of Tories whilst bad isn t AS bad
This helps It stops the Brexit question disrupting our country again We have to move on Now it comes back to the delivery capability of the Tories looking at what they have already done the electorate might wake up again sooner rather than later Lets ensure he Gets it Done
Well there s nothing the Tories do better than to get in formation I guess But I m still amazed the rhetoric of get Brexit done didn t put more Tory Remainers off But then I was pretty gobsmacked by some of the reasons given for not voting Labour so maybe I know nothing
That is the factor that will stop a recovery the wrong leader and a failure to address the lack of appeal to those in the North and Midlands that felt the need to switch to push Brexit through However don t discount the difficulties the Tories have ahead
Deluded and a Loser Ran an Us v Them caign driven by fear eg NHS not safe in Tories hands etc Total nonsense Ran a fear caign whereas Boris caign was very positive Get Brexit done
People actually think the Tories are keeping the north after brexit lmao
Nonsense John Curtice said the Brexit Party took more votes from Tories You did great work up to the calling of the election and then lost the plot Egos Remember Tories can t take seats held by labour for 50 years well they could and they did Here is TBP legacy
And Boris  the Tories only got 43 Does that mean they don t have a mandate for Brexit
2 The CAA claims to be non party political Its website review of the main political parties excluding the Brexit Party gives Labour a higher antisemitism score than either the Tories or UKIP The CAA s website discloses the full flavour of this organisation
fell by the wayside Unfortunately when you give people a choice and then try to deny them that choice they are going to flick v signs We say the Tories were pulled apart by Brexit sadly it was our undoing On that issue alone we gave the Tories the win Perhaps it doesn t
Irrelevant to five years time a decent proportion of Labour leaders switched either because of Get Brexit Done or Corbyn Neither will hopefully be a factor in five years and the Tories will have hit a few bumps in the road with Johnson and his useless cronies at the helm
I doubt Labour lost many Remain voters Where d they go Lib Dems They barely kept a few of Lib Demmers Tories Maybe a few staunch defenders of democracy went that way Abstained Voting Labour pretty much was abstaining re Brexit so why desert them They lost 2mill Leavers
Good luck to you and them for voting the vile Tories I ll ask you again when you re on universal credits when the economy tanks because of brexit
I mean obviously this guy should be in UKIP or the Brexit Party and nowhere near the governing party of this country It also tells us a lot and not good things about the vetting process of the Tories
Jeanette you so get it British Tories Brexit Considered the Conservative players in Parliament do not involve the onus of our social conservative platform making for a much easier win The Dimms are Corbynites but the GOP platform is the sticking point
Well the Tories own Brexit now for good or ill It s theirs
But it s tories brexit not convinced that translates to better off
And it s bit contempt that I feel It s more a sense of being disheartened that people knowingly fell for the lies the Tories put out and that they placed a Tory brexit above the damage caused by the last 9 years of Tory austerity And they voted for a party that shafted them

Brexit will force companies to offshore more jobs and will increase debt Its a right wing project to dismantle regulation and social protections
and create even more jobs They believe EU contribution funds will be ploughed into the NHS thereby solving the current crisis In short they believe every major problem the country faces right now can be resolved by Brexit That said
They truly believe that Brexit will deliver a crock of gold that their areas will receive more investment from money saved by not paying into the EU They believe more jobs will be around due to stricter immigration controls They believe industries like fishing will recover

I have a lot of respect for you but your stance on Brexit has cost the election You ve let a lot of people down and cost people their jobs What hurts the most is that you knew it was going to happen GeneralElection GE2019
And that complacency had a large part to play in why those Labour voters believed Brexit would solve their problems Problems which were to do with austerity and also the void left with collapse of traditional manufacturing jobs
Despite Brexit  Corbyn s unpopularity shocked so many northern seats voted for a manifesto with 5 more years of austerity Only positive is Tories will find excuses for failures harder to make on jobs NHS Brexit Scotland but that won t help those suffering under austerity

Why other people s jobs why do you presume my job isn t affected Ultimately far fewer jobs would have been sacrificed Sadly absolutely zero ppl I spoke to on the doorsteps in the North mentioned the risk of Brexit to the their jobs They just wanted it done

as a citizen of the EU myself I ask that you do not give the UK not even a single day extension Let them have a hard Brexit  drown in the misery they brought upon themselves No jobs in EU for them  get their citizens out Let Trump save their soul
Let s hope Boris Johnson manages to negotiate a Brexit that isn t too harmful to jobs holds the union together and protects the EU citizens that have made the U K their home Hopefully the divisive rhetoric of the caign will cease

That is the point No one is fixing the issue about people getting poorer declining mobility no jobs more austerity Less GDP when Brexit happensThe problem was this Brexit was the focus not the election It sucks so bad Googling teaching jobs and house prices in Toronto
